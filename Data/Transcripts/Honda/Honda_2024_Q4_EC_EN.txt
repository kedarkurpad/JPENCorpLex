In addition to the dominant motorcycle business base we have in Asia, expansion of sales of large motorcycles in developed countries as well as enhancement of our product lineup in South America has served to further strengthen our business structure and led to the realization of well-balanced global performance and the formation of a profitable business structure. In automobile business operations, where profitability was an issue, expansion of the commonality ratio of core models such as the CR-V, CIVIC and ACCORD - among others, cost reductions and the increased product appeal of our hybrid system as well as other measures, have led to steady improvement of our business structure. With respect to our hybrid system, in the second half of the 2020’s, we plan to achieve an even higher level of advanced performance as well as cost improvement.Towards Increasing Corporate Value Past Present Future Decline in capital Anxiety due to Analysis on Profitability of efficiencydue to uncertainty about low PBR capitalaccumulation Automobile Business electrification Establishment and Direction of Optimization of Capital Continuation of Earnings base Enhancement of Resolution of Approach through Proactive Operating Profit Margin Electrification Strategy ShareholderReturns FY26：above 7.0% Acquisition of the OperatingProfit Margin Towards future growth, Company’s Own Shares FY24/FY25 FY24：6.8% electrificationstrategyand FY24：250.0 bil. yen FY25：7.0% capital allocation announcement Initiatives FY25：300.0 bil. yen Capital Efficiency Operating Profit Margin （Adetailedexplanation is planned as FY24ROIC 9.1% Aim to achieve goal year part of “2024 Honda BusinessBriefing” onMay16th ） ahead of schedule Aim to achieve a PBR of more than 1x in the near future through various initiatives ＋ continuous dialogue with the stock market ROIC：) / Invested capital(Equity attributable to owners of the parent + Interest-bearing liabilities ).
