So�Bank Group Corp.: FY23Q3 Global Conference Call Q&A Presenters: Yoshimitsu Goto, Board Director, Corporate Officer, Senior Vice President, CFO & CISO, Head of Finance Unit & Administra�on Unit Kazuko Kimiwada, Corporate Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Accoun�ng Unit Yotaro Agari, CSusO, Head of Investor Rela�ons Department & Sustainability Department Navneet Govil, CFO, SB Investment Advisers & SB Global Advisers Q&A I was wondering if there are any strategic points to glean from the con�nued holding companies over indexing on incremental investment rela�ve to SVF over the last few quarters. Is that something that we should con�nue to expect? In addi�on, does that have any implica�ons that we should consider when thinking about future results? As we have explained in previous quarters, we will con�nue to ac�vely invest in AI-based companies through SVF in terms of our future investment style. At the same �me, we plan to ac�vely invest in companies that can become our strategic partners on SBG's own account. There has been a lot of news around efforts to reduce regulatory hurdles for public company repor�ng in Japan. These include proposals to reduce the �me to list companies in public markets and other proposals around Japanese capital markets ac�vity. Given the over indexing of equity in the U.S., is there any poten�al focus or refocus on investment in Japan given these developments? I assume you are asking about reforms in the Japanese IPO market. Un�l now, the Japanese market has tended to take a rela�vely long �me to go public compared to overseas markets, but I believe that efforts are being made to improve this situa�on. From this perspec�ve, the number of IPOs by entrepreneurs in Japan may increase more than before. I think that is a welcome development. There was also a ques�on as to whether there is an inten�on to increase investment in Japan. I think that is a different issue. We make investment decisions based on a close examina�on of the quality of companies from a global perspec�ve. Therefore, in terms of regions, we have a clear stance of limi�ng investment in China, but other than that, we basically invest everywhere on a borderless basis. This ques�on is around net new investment in a different way. You men�oned the Anthropic mul�ple and OpenAI mul�ple. How do you think about the trajectory of these mul�ples in terms of opening the door for incremental investment? In other words, is there a scenario where the mul�ple versus what you are willing to pay has run away from you for the sector overall, you need to wait for a pullback, or is this about incremental players in the space that are maybe earlier stage than you would normally engage in order for you to have an entry point? There are a couple of things that are driving the mul�ples. It has a lot of strategic investors there. There is a lot of momentum in this space. The other thing is that we also need to recognize that we are in the very early innings of a very fast-growing space where disruptors can be very quickly disrupted. If you look at search engines, Google came much later. There used to be AltaVista and a bunch of other search engines, and then Google came a�erwards. If you look at food delivery, we invested in DoorDash, and there were many other food delivery companies that were there before DoorDash came. What is a product today could easily get acquired by another company, and they could be a product feature. Is this a company that can have posi�ve unit economics, can really scale? What we are seeing is a lot of these companies require a lot of compute power. They are very capital- intensive. It is not a ques�on of that we are wai�ng for a pullback. What we are seeing is we are in the very early stages of some of these things. We are focused on four key factors, the quality of the AI tech stack, product market fit scalability, unit economics, execu�on, excellence. If you look at some of the companies that we have invested in, we have invested in companies that are truly u�lizing ar�ficial intelligence. ByteDance uses ar�ficial intelligence algorithms to power personalized content. Swiggy provides a genera�ve AI led solu�on for India restaurants and delivery partners ecosystem. ContractPod augments its contract lifecycle management capabili�es through a genera�ve AI legal assistant, which allows faster contract analysis. You look at LabelBox, which uses latest model foundry product, allows rapid data experimenta�on with all major AI founda�on models. Then Tractable, which is a recent investment, uses best in class AI technology and powers instant visual assessments for auto insurance claims. If you look at the stock market performance in the December quarter where NASDAQ and S&P were up, but they were really driven by the Magnificent 7. Everybody recognizes the AI revolu�on and they want to invest in AI. They cannot invest in ByteDance, which is a private company. They cannot invest in Swiggy, which is a private company. They cannot invest in ContractPod, which is a private company. They cannot invest in LabelBox, which is a private company. What do they invest in? They invest in the Magnificent 7, which is a proxy for AI. We have investments 2in ByteDance, in Swiggy, in ContractPod, in LabelBox. It is a mater of �me before there will be significant disrup�on and value to be unlocked here. That is why we feel prety good about our por�olio. The yen is weak again and Japan is looking quite cheap. Does this influence any of your decisions on �ming around buybacks? The reason why I ask this ques�on is that you have a lot of overseas assets and it just seems your shares are heavily discounted. I do not believe that currency exchange rates have a significant impact on share buyback decisions. Rather, I think it is more essen�al to consider the balance of capital alloca�on through various discussions on the �ming of shareholder returns, which is more fundamental. You men�oned companies looking to IPO on the NASDAQ. From your point of view, could you talk through some of the signs you are looking for to give you confidence in ge�ng a large number of the por�olio out there? First, if you just look at what happened last year, why is it that of the companies that went public at the �me that Arm went public, it was Arm that has done extremely well, but some of the others have not done well? For instance, there was Instacart that went public, Clavio went public, and a couple of others that went public. I think what the market and the ins�tu�onal investors are telling us is that these companies need to have strong fundamentals. They either have to be profitable or they have to have posi�ve unit economics and be on the path to profitability. They have to show strong, top-line growth. And then, management needs to have visibility into future performance. If you look at Arm again, they are able to provide guidance, which only gets beter every quarter. Those are the types of companies that I believe will be able to go public and do well. It is not so much a market overall dynamic. It is more just ge�ng the right companies at the right �ming. I believe so, yes. I know you talked a lot about how you are doing a lot of prepara�on for going back on offense and inves�ng. Even though a lot of deals did not happen, you are ready to. However, I want to know whether you have seen a shi� in how the companies that you are talking to are valuing themselves. Are they s�ll thinking that valua�on should be higher? Or are you star�ng to see that the valua�ons are ge�ng more realis�c? When you are talking to private companies, do you think they have a realis�c view of what they are worth? It depends on which sector we are looking at. Now, clearly, if you are looking at genera�ve AI, it is a very different story. So, let us look at Anthropic valua�on. It rose by ten �mes in two years to $5.5 billion in May 2023. And then it rose by another four �mes to $25 billion in October 2023. Anthropic's revenue mul�ple is �mes, Hugging Face is �mes, Glean is �mes, Harvey is �mes, and OpenAI is �mes. It really depends on what sector you are looking at. Now, if you look at some of the investments we made, like Cato Networks, Tractable, and a bunch of others, we did those investments because we felt that the valua�ons were prudent and they made sense on a risk- adjusted basis. In genera�ve AI, there is a lot of momentum. And what we are seeing is there are strategic investors. We are financial investors. If you look at the investments we have made, we look at valua�ons very carefully. What is your base case for how the U.S. economy develops this year? Are you feeling confident that a so� landing is coming? Do you have any con�ngencies in case that turns out to not be the case? The so� landing is s�ll the base case in the U.S. and it is supported by con�nued modera�ng infla�on. What we saw in was a�er four decades of low infla�on, infla�on was over 9%. And in 2023, we saw great progress where infla�on went from over 9% to today it is in the 3% range. But there is risk that comes from geopoli�cal tensions, especially in the Middle East. Then there is also ease of financial condi�ons. What I mean by that is interest rate cuts. The U.S. Fed plot shows median expecta�on of basis point cuts. The other thing is there is a lot of capital si�ng on the sidelines and the IPO market will reopen at some point. Arm did very well in September of last year, but if you look at the other companies that went public, they did not do so well at all. NASDAQ CEO, Adina Friedman, has said that there are companies that have filed to go public on the NASDAQ. We believe that great companies will and are wai�ng to come to the market. The only ques�on is when. Alibaba used to be 50% of NAV in 2019. And now Arm is 32%. At this valua�on of Arm, even though 4it is very successful over the last couple of months, are you worried that the concentra�on risk has been rising? And what do you do to diversify this risk? I think this issue will always be discussed. It is a very happy thing when a por�olio company grows and increases its corporate value, but when the corporate value becomes too large, it becomes a concern for investors and credit, which has happened several �mes in our history with the ra�ng agencies. However, we believe that the liquidity of large, blue-chip listed stocks is extremely important, so we do not think that the large market share of these stocks should have a significant impact on our corporate value. Of course, the ra�ng agencies have their own views, and we will listen to them as well. You men�oned you are going to do offensive in combina�on with defensive, which changes the tone from purely defense to offense. Can you explain what has changed? Is it because of the valua�on of some of the Magnificent 7? Has it caused some cau�on? We had made the decision to stop inves�ng from two years ago to last year. However, I am sure you are all aware that the environment is changing. To improve our performance as an investment firm, it is not enough to increase the value of our exis�ng por�olio; incorpora�ng new stocks into our investment por�olio is a very important ac�on. Therefore, since last April, we have decided to enter this stage, and we have clearly communicated our message of resuming new investments. However, I would like to add to this message that we will be very careful in our investment decisions, as we need to learn from our past mistakes. NASDAQ used to be the proxy of SBG un�l the WeWork thing happened. I was curious internally what you look at the sector as your proxy. I believe that our stock prices are currently most closely linked to the SOX index of semiconductor indices. Although our stock prices are not completely synchronized, the recent fluctua�ons in stock prices are more similar than the chart of the Nikkei 225, and considering the shi� to AI centered on Arm, I suspect that the SOX index is the one to which we are most closely linked. Regarding the realiza�on, you men�oned this is in the early stage of the AI boom. So, how long will we have to wait un�l your por�olio companies realize your profit? How long will it take them to be 5listed? When we make an investment our underwri�ng case is three to five years. So, we would expect to see value accre�on in three to five years, on any typical investment. I have a ques�on on strategic investments by SBG. You men�oned that if some of the companies could be strategic partners, the investment could be done directly by SBG rather than through SVF. Could you provide a litle bit more color on that objec�ve? Based on the reference to some of the historical examples and what types of companies in what areas do you think would qualify more into strategic partner category with investment directly by SBG versus investments through SVF? To be honest, I think it is difficult to draw a clear line. However, if it is an investment where financial exit is looked for from the beginning of the investment process, I believe that would s�ll be an investment in a fund. For example, it will take quite some �me to exit and successfully recoup the investment, but if we think the management team has a great idea, business model, or technology, we will support the company as a firm and watch it grow in the long run based on strategic alliances. For such an investment, direct investment by SBG is suitable. As specific examples, companies such as Stack AV, a U.S. auto-driving company, and Berkshire Grey in robo�cs and Mapbox are companies that should pursue longer-term value crea�on and have clear themes. Therefore, we invest in these investments on our own account. Therefore, we would first consider SVF as the entry point for investment, but for companies that require more strategic decisions and a longer-term perspec�ve in terms of investment recovery, we would like to work on direct investment by SBG. Another ques�on on new opportuni�es for SVF. As you look at various industries and sectors out there, which sectors do you find have more atrac�ve or reasonable valua�ons? In addi�on, where would you might be finding more reasonable opportuni�es right now or on a 12-month horizon based on your expecta�ons? We are a sector and region agnos�c. We look at all investments whether they are pure play AI investments or they are leveraging AI. We will invest wherever we find the best opportuni�es. This is a debt-related ques�on. On page of finance sec�on of the investor presenta�on materials, you clearly indicate the u�liza�on of debt capacity this �me, and I would like to ask you how you see it going forward. On page of the same document, you men�oned that you will con�nue to focus on refinancing of corporate bonds in FY2023, but this �me, in addi�on to the fact that you have clearly men�oned the u�liza�on of debt capacity, and with the split payment of Arm shares, the overseas market seems to have improved a litle in terms of the procurement environment, especially since the beginning of the new year. I would appreciate any comments you may have on the use of debt capacity, although this may be a topic for the next fiscal year. The u�liza�on of debt capacity that we are talking about here indicates the level of our credit capacity, so this chart is not suitable for specific discussions about what specific procurement will be easier in which market, and how to make a large procurement there. When we fund our investment por�olio, we will have cash and a degree of financial leeway. Then you can use that cash directly as capital alloca�on, or on the other hand, if you use it for financial improvement, it will not contribute directly to procurement at that point, but you will accumulate the strength to procure at any �me. Therefore, we would like to create a mechanism for this cycle from a financial strategy standpoint, as it will make it easier to use this strength to procure offensively when needed, in other words, it will be easier to procure at any �me by improving finances. In summary, I would like to tell you that we would like you to think of capital alloca�on used for financial improvement as also a prepara�on for stronger cash crea�on in the future. When I look at the debt calcula�on, I look at all the debt. If we were to categorize all the standalone debt for SBG, I would be adding the margin loans. I would also be adding the other $12 billion that is s�ll outstanding from SBG to SVF. If we make those adjustments, what is the LTV ra�o? Without that, it is 11.5%. But with that adjustment, what would it come out to? There are many ways of thinking about how to calculate LTV, but we have a very long history of dealing with debt and have a lot of experience. Each ra�ng agency and investor has their own LTV approach, and I think they should feel free to do so. However, I am confident that SBG's current method of calcula�ng LTV is the most accurate way to evaluate our credit. Besides the $12 billion that SBG owes to SVF, are there any other liabili�es like margin loan? I think there was about a $10 billion margin loan with Arm. All debts are disclosed. I would like to confirm your approach to share buybacks in the future. Given that you are priori�zing investment, what will you focus on in the future when deciding on the direc�on of shareholder returns? Is it the stock price level or the investment? The level of the stock price is the biggest factor. The level of discount is of course important, but when the stock price and Net Asset Value are rising steadily, share buybacks will not provide as much return or contribu�on as when they are low. One major factor is that if we are going to do a share buyback, we would like to make a significant contribu�on, and in that case, we should probably do it when the stock price level is low. There are s�ll many large companies that have not submited measures such as capital efficiency improvement to the TSE. Perhaps you are saying that it does not mater because SBG is focusing on NAV, etc. Please let us know if there is any direc�on or policy that SBG will take regarding this in the future. We take pride in the fact that we are the company that thinks about this topic the most among Japanese companies. Therefore, when we are asked by the TSE what we think about these issues, our a�tude is, “What are you talking about now?” We have been doing this kind of management for a long �me, so we think this is a message to companies that have not done so in the past. Unfortunately, in Japan, there are many companies that have not done so. We believe that this is a message to those companies, so we do not need to give specific messages one by one. I have two ques�ons around the Arm investment. You own 90% of the company a�er the IPO. Can you just confirm that I believe there are some shares that are pledged in an asset-backed deal? The second ques�on number is, if and when you choose to sell down the investment, are there addi�onal tax implica�ons that we should be mindful of? For the assets we are using, we have a margin loan with 75% of the outstanding shares pledged as collateral with a generous collateral advance. Regarding taxes, of course it depends on the sale price, but considering the current price, I think it is straigh�orward to assume that taxes would be paid. I am just conscious of your comment on doing share buybacks when the share momentum is bad. But it does not necessarily require the shares to go down for the NAV discount to widen, because if SBG share price con�nuously underperform the investment assets, then ul�mately the NAV discount will con�nue to widen. So, when you think about share buyback, is the share price momentum the best gauge, or is the NAV discount something we consider? In addi�on, how do you think about this 50% NAV discount now? There is no doubt that the discount in the stock price is one factor. However, considering the discount alone, I do not believe the �ming is necessarily correct. In terms of capital alloca�on, we are also considering other uses of funds, new investments, and financial improvement. However, I think the environment in which our priori�es are highest is when the stock price itself is low. At that �me, I think there is more ra�onale for buybacks than for other uses of funds. In other cases, we need to focus more on strategic investments to increase Net Asset Value from the perspec�ve of improving investment performance. Regarding the LTV, 25% seems to be a range which is comfortable. Do you have a target or a plan to hit that 25%? Or is 25% just a so� limit as opposed to a hard limit of 35%? We do not have any idea of ge�ng closer to 25% or anything like that. However, we do say 25% at investor presenta�ons as a common understanding that we are giving you a Loan to Value guideline as a mater of policy. 25% is a safe number to begin with. So, as long as we are conduc�ng our investment ac�vi�es within this safe range, I think it is very easy for people to see that our finances are safe. I believe that when we go above 25%, we are entering a stage where we must be more serious about prudent investment ac�vity and long-term financial stability. To prevent this from happening, we will con�nue to consider opera�ng within 25%, which we give you as a guideline. Therefore, we do not have the very idea of when we will reach 25%. There was a phase when the NAV was falling and the stock price fell further, causing the NAV discount to widen, but I believe that in such a case, even if the company does share buybacks, the stock price 9will s�ll weaken because the NAV is falling. Right now, I feel that the NAV is going up and the discount is expanding because the stock price is not catching up to it, which is more like a good discount. Mr. Goto men�oned earlier that the stock price level is one of the guidelines for share buybacks, but I have a feeling that share buybacks will not work unless the NAV is rising. Of course, when the NAV is rising, it is the very �me when sales and profits are increasing for a company that looks at its P/L. However, if the stock price is also rising at a discount at that �me, the cost-effec�veness of the share buyback may not be significant. If we are going to conduct a share buyback, we would like to do it at a �me when the effect would be large. However, there is a risk of only a temporary decrease in NAV discount from share buybacks, so we need to consider whether the capital invested in share buybacks is really func�oning effec�vely as a return to shareholders, and whether, perhaps, new investment would have produced a beter effect for shareholders than buybacks. I believe that this is a theme for us to ponder. It is not an easy ques�on to answer, but I understand what you are saying. We would like to deepen our thoughts as we receive these and other comments. 10Disclaimers This presenta�on provides relevant informa�on about So�Bank Group Corp. and its subsidiaries (together with SBG, the “Company”) and its affiliates and does not cons�tute or form any solicita�on of investment including any offer to buy or subscribe for any securi�es in any jurisdic�on.
