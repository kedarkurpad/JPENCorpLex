Increase in losses from hardwaremainly due to promotions 337.0 385 250.0 270 FY23 FY23 FY22 November FCT February FCT • First is the Game & Network Services segment. • FY23 Q3 sales increased a significant 16% year-on-year to trillion 444.4 billion yen, primarily due to increased third-party software sales and the impact of foreign exchange rates. • Operating income decreased a significant 30.1 billion yen year-on-year to 86.1 billion yen, primarily due to a deterioration in the profitability of PlayStation hardware mainly due to promotions and adjusted OIBDA decreased 26.8 billion yen to 113.1 billion yen. • The full-year forecast is for sales to be trillion billion yen, a decrease of billion yen from the previous forecast, and operating income and adjusted OIBDA to be unchanged. • Inventory-related reserves that were additionally recorded in the current quarter mainly due to an increase in inventory resulting from a decline in PS5 unit sales in the current quarter are expected to be recorded as a recovery gain in the fourth quarter due to a decrease in inventory. • As a result, there is no impact on our full-year operating income forecast, but there is an expected shift in profit of approximately billion yen from the current quarter to the fourth quarter. 5Current State of the Business • PS5 hardware unit sales in the quarter were 8.2 million units, which fell short of the target to hit our annual shipment target of million units, but was a record high number of quarterly unit sales for PS5, and PS5 cumulative sales have exceeded million units. • Due to the impact of the increasing popularity of PS5 and third-party free-to-play hit titles, key user engagement metrics increased significantly with monthly active users for all of PlayStation in December reaching a record high of million accounts and total game play time for the quarter increasing 13% year-on-year. • Based on the results for this quarter, PS5 unit sales for this fiscal year are expected to be around million units. • Regarding first-party software, the cumulative sales of Marvelʼs Spider- Man 2, which was released last October, exceeded million copies as of February 4, and the Marvelʼs Spider-Man game series has now sold- through over million units including sales from PC. • The game is our second blockbuster hit in two years following God of War Ragnarok, which was released in the same period last year, and is making a major contribution to profits. • Regarding network services, despite the impact of a slight year-on- year decrease in the number of PlayStation Plus subscribers, revenue increased 11% year-on-year, mainly due to the impacts of a further shift to premium services and price revisions. 6Outlook for Next Fiscal Year（compared to the current fiscal year） PS5 Hardware unit sales Gradual decline Decrease, with no plan for Software sales release of major franchise titles Burden of acquisition-related Easing costs First-party software profit Slight decrease Third-party software sales Gradual expansion Network Services revenue Gradual expansion • Now, I would like to explain our current view on the outlook for this segment next fiscal year. • Regarding the PS5 hardware, which will enter its fifth year since launch, partially due to its entering the latter half of the console cycle, we aim to optimize sales with a greater emphasis on the balance with profits, so we anticipate a gradual decline in unit sales from next fiscal year onwards. • We expect third-party software sales to continue to expand gradually due to the expansion of the PS5 installed base and the high level of user engagement. • In network services, we expect subscribers to be on par with this fiscal year or slightly less due to the impact of price revisions we implemented in this fiscal year, but we expect sales to gradually expand due to a shift to attractive premium services. • Regarding first-party software, we aim to continue to focus on producing high-quality works and developing live service games, but, while major projects are currently under development, we do not plan to release any new major existing franchise titles next fiscal year like God of War Ragnarok and Marvelʼs Spider-Man. • Although the burden of acquisition-related costs will ease next fiscal year, we expect profit from first-party software to decrease slightly from this fiscal year due to the impact of the decrease in sales. • Based on this, operating income for next fiscal year is currently expected to increase slightly from this fiscal year. However, while this is our base-line, we are reviewing measures for further improvement in profitability in advance of the annual financial results announcement this May. 7Music Segment Sales, Operating Income and Adjusted OIBDA Q3FY2023 Sales OperatingIncome Sales: 58.4 blnyen significant increase Adjusted OIBDA ・HighersalesforRecordedMusicandMusicPublishingfrompaid subscriptionstreamingservices ・Higherrevenuesformerchandise,licenseandothersalesinRecordedMusic 422.1 363.7 ・Impactofforeignexchangerates OI: 13.1 blnyen significant increase 98.5 / Adjusted OIBDA: 19.9 blnyen significant increase 63.078.6 76.1 ・ImpactofincreaseinRecordedMusicandMusicPublishingsales ・Increaseinselling,generalandadministrativeexpenses Q3 FY22 Q3 FY23 FY2023Forecast Sales:10blnyenupwardrevision 1,560 1,570 1,380.6 ・Impactofforeignexchangerates OI:RemainsunchangedfromNovemberforecast /AdjustedOIBDA:10blnyenupwardrevision 316.4 360 263.1 295 ・Improvementinprofitability ・Increaseindepreciationandamortizationexpenses* FY22 FY23 FY23 for change in operating income only, not included in factors for change in Adjusted OIBDA. November FCT February FCT • Next is the Music segment. • FY23 Q3 sales increased 16% year-on-year to 422.1 billion yen and operating income increased 13.1 billion yen to 76.1 billion yen, both significant increases. • Adjusted OIBDA increased 19.9 billion yen year-on-year to 98.5 billion yen. • Streaming revenue for the quarter on a U.S. dollar basis continued to grow, increasing 12% for Recorded Music and 17% for Music Publishing. • Profit contribution from Visual Media and Platform was a mid-single digits percentage of the operating income of the segment. • The FY23 forecast is for sales to increase billion yen from the previous forecast to trillion billion yen, operating income to be unchanged and adjusted OIBDA to increase billion yen to billion yen. 8Revenue Opportunities Through Music Catalogs • In recent years, the expansion of the streaming market has greatly expanded the revenue opportunities and asset value of music catalogs that have been released for a certain period of time. • During the quarter, the total streams of five of our holiday song catalogs by our artists exceeded billion in the U.S. • Mariah Careyʼs album “Merry Christmas,” ranked in the top ten of SMEʼs album sales for the quarter, years after it was released. • In Music Publishing, the use of catalogs synchronized with images such as background music for movies and advertisements is also an important source of revenue. • To date, we have established a strong foundation that we expect will contribute to achieving stable revenue and expanding our market share in the music business by acquiring the publishing rights to the large catalog works held by EMI Music Publishing and the catalogs of industry-leading artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Paul Simon. • Moreover, depending on the rights for each catalog, we plan to expand opportunities to use the music and are working to create new revenue such as in the artist merchandise and event promotion areas. 9The 66th Grammy Awards Miley Cyrus Victoria Monét SZA Record of the Year Best New Artist Best R&B Song Best Pop Solo Performance Best Progressive R&B Album Best Pop Duo/Group Performance • Of the four major awards presented at the 66th Grammy Awards on February 5, Miley Cyrus won Record of the Year and Victoria Monet won Best New Artist. • Sony Music Group artists and songwriters won awards in multiple other categories including SZA, who was nominated in nine categories, the most of any artist this year, and won in three of them. 10Pictures Segment Sales, Operating Income and Adjusted OIBDA Sales Q3FY2023 OperatingIncome The following analysis is on a U.S. dollar basis AdjustedOIBDA Sales: 34.8 blnyen significant increase 366.3 331.5 · Increase in television and digital streaming licensing revenues as well as home entertainment sales, mainly due to contribution of theatrical releases in FY23 · Increase in revenues for Crunchyroll due to paid subscriber growth · Decrease in theatrical revenues 54.6 38.2 41.6 25.4 OI: 16.2 blnyen significant increase Q3 FY22 Q3 FY23 / Adjusted OIBDA: 16.3 blnyen significant increase · Impact of increase in sales FY2023Forecast 1,460 1,470 1,369.4 Sales:10blnyenupwardrevision ·Impactofforeignexchangerates OI/ Adjusted OIBDA:Remain unchanged from November forecast 168.2 165 119.3 115 FY23 FY23 FY22 November FCT February FCT • Next is the Pictures segment. • In the current quarter, sales increased by 10% year-on-year to 366.3 billion yen, and operating income increased significantly 16.2 billion yen year-on-year to 41.6 billion yen, mainly due to increases in television and digital streaming licensing revenues and home entertainment sales in Motion Pictures. • Adjusted OIBDA increased 16.3 billion yen year-on-year to 54.6 billion yen. • The FY23 forecast is for sales to increase billion yen from the previous forecast to trillion billion yen and for operating income and adjusted OIBDA to be unchanged. 11Impact of Strikes Pictures Segment Operating Income Close to double the impact amount as in FY23 Negative impact slightly less than Bln Yen Estimated impact 119.3 BlnYen due to the strikes Operating Income FY22 FY23 FY24 Forecast＊ Expected＊ of February • Although the Hollywood strikes have finally ended, delays in script development have caused continued changes in movie release schedules and delays in the delivery of television shows. As a result, we estimate the impact of the strikes on profits in the current fiscal year to be a little less than billion yen. • Next fiscal year, in addition to continued delays in releases, it is expected that digital streaming licensing and other revenues will decline due to a decrease in the number of films released this fiscal year, so the negative impact on profits due to the strikes is expected to reach its peak and the amount of such impact on a U.S. dollar basis is expected to be slightly less than twice as much as in the current fiscal year. 12Current State of the Business ©2024 Sony Pictures Entertainment. All Rights Reserved. • On the other hand, the paying subscribers of Crunchyroll, which is driving growth in this segment, exceeded million as of the end of December last year and have expanded at an average pace of 23% a year since we acquired the business in August 2021. • In addition to continuing to provide appealing anime content to core fans, we are focusing on measures to broaden the anime fan base and deepen engagement by collaborating with external partners such as Amazon, expanding the service into growth markets such as Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia, and further expanding in business areas such as theatrical distribution of anime movies and e-commerce. • Amortization costs associated with the acquisition are expected to decrease significantly from next fiscal year onwards, and we expect this to further contribute to profit in this segment. 13Outlook for Next Fiscal Year ©2024 Sony Pictures Entertainment. All Rights Reserved. • For the next fiscal year, despite the challenging environment where the impact from the strikes on profitability is expected to increase, we are aiming for a level of operating income that exceeds the current fiscal year as we intend to further grow our Crunchyroll business, develop and produce content all over the world, enhance theatrical distribution by distributing films from third-party studios, and maintain our strong focus on cost control. 14Entertainment, Technology & Services Segment Sales, Operating Income and Adjusted OIBDA Sales Q3FY2023 OperatingIncome Sales:17.1blnyendecrease AdjustedOIBDA · Decrease in sales of televisions resulting from lower unit sales 752.8 735.7 · Impact of foreign exchange rates OI: 3.9 blnyen decrease / Adjusted OIBDA: 1.9 blnyen decrease 105.3 103.4 81.1 77.2 · Impact of lower unit sales of televisions · Positive impact of foreign exchange rates Q3FY22 Q3FY23 FY2023Forecast 2,476.0 2,440 2,430 Sales:10blnyendownwardrevision · Decrease in sales of televisions resulting from lower unit sales · Impact of foreign exchange rates OI/AdjustedOIBDA:RemainunchangedfromNovemberforecast 276.9 280 · Impact of lower unit sales of televisions 179.5 180 · Reductionsin operating expenses FY23 FY23 FY22 November FCT February FCT • Next is the Entertainment, Technology & Services segment. • FY23 Q3 sales decreased 2% year-on-year to 735.7 billion yen, mainly due to lower sales of televisions, and operating income decreased 3.9 billion yen to 77.2 billion yen and adjusted OIBDA was 103.4 billion yen, down 1.9 billion yen. • The FY23 forecast is for sales to decrease billion yen from our previous forecast to trillion billion yen, and for operating income and adjusted OIBDA to be unchanged. 15Current State of the Business • Looking at the overall year-end selling season, the season generally proceeded as expected. • In the North American market, there was no sign of a major decline in demand, as had been expected, and sales were relatively steady. • In the Chinese market, while demand for televisions fell sharply, demand for digital cameras was higher than expected, and overall performance was roughly in-line with expectations. • Furthermore, as a result of careful production and sales control, the overall inventory level in the segment at the end of December, was significantly reduced to 341.3 billion yen, a 18% decrease year-on-year. • Regarding televisions in the fourth quarter, we plan to further reduce inventory and reduce costs based on the results of the year-end selling season. Regarding digital cameras and interchangeable lenses, we aim to continue to expand our business, including through the introduction of new products to the market. 16Imaging & Sensing Solutions Segment

February FCT for change in operating income only, not included in factors for change in Adjusted OIBDA. • Next is the Imaging & Sensing Solutions segment. • FY23 sales for the quarter increased significantly 21% year-on-year to 505.2 billion yen primarily due to an increase in sales of image sensors for mobile, and operating income increased 14.9 billion yen to 99.7 billion yen, both new record highs for the segment. • Adjusted OIBDA increased 29.0 billion yen year-on-year to 163.7 billion yen. • The FY23 forecast is unchanged from the previous forecast. 17Current State of the Business • We believe that the smartphone product market, which has continued to experience negative growth compared to the last calendar year, has hit the bottom in the current quarter, but the North American market is still showing declines compared to the last calendar year, and there is still uncertainty in the outlook. • During the quarter, sales increased significantly year-on-year primarily due to a recovery of the smartphone product market and the introduction of large-sized sensors for high-end products. • Nevertheless, we plan to continue to operate our business cautiously for the time being while continuing to monitor product market trends and inventory status. • The yield rate of mobile sensors, which is the most important issue for the current fiscal year, is progressing, following the improvement curve assumed in the previous forecast, and the impact on profitability has not changed from the previous forecast. • Regarding the sensor business other than mobile sensors, the delay in recovery in the sensor market for industrial and social infrastructure has become particularly noticeable, so we plan to proceed with production adjustments and improve inventory in the fourth quarter. 18オペレーションのO継u続tlo進o化k for Next Fiscal Year and Beyond I&SS Segment Sales Trend 1,590 Average annual sales growth rate forecast 1,402.2 1,076.4 +22％ Yen basis: +8% U.S. Dollar basis: FY21 FY22 FY23 value calculated by translating quarterlysales February FCT in yen at the quarterly average rate. • Sales in the segment during the current mid-range plan are expected to grow significantly by an average of 22% per year on a yen basis and 8% on a U.S. dollar basis. • We have been able to steadily transition our mobile sensors to becoming larger and more value-added, and we believe that we will be able to continue to grow our business in the period of the next mid- range plan. • On the other hand, at a time when sales are not increasing as planned, primarily due to the market environment, we recognize that the significant increase in manufacturing costs, mainly due to capital expenditures, and production operation losses such as those brought on by a deterioration in yield, are issues that need to be addressed in order to further improve profitability going forward. • Regarding image sensor capital expenditures in the period of the next mid-range plan, we plan to leverage the production capacity and strategic inventory we have built-up ahead of time and to optimize new investment. 19Financial Services Segment Financial Services Revenue, Q3FY2023

Excluding the recording of the gain mainly from the transfer I just mentioned, we have made no change to our previous forecast. 20Outlook for Next Fiscal Year and Beyond • Finally, I would like to speak about the main points regarding the forecast for this fiscal year and the outlook for each business in next fiscal year and beyond. • Regarding the outlook for the current fiscal year, consolidated operating income for the quarter reached a level approaching the record high level achieved in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended , and I think we have created good momentum toward completing the current mid-range plan. • Looking ahead to next fiscal year, in the G&NS segment, we expect operating income to slightly increase from the current fiscal year as the gradual growth in third-party software and network services due to the expansion of the PS5 installed base offsets a decrease in profit from first-party software. • In the Pictures segment, although the impact of the strikes is expected to peak next fiscal year, we are aiming for a level of operating income that exceeds the current fiscal year mainly due to the expected growth of Crunchyroll, development of our global production and thorough control of costs. • In the I&SS segment, we expect moderate sales growth due to a recovery of the smartphone market as well as an increase in the size and value add of mobile sensors, which we have been promoting to date. Regarding image sensor capital expenditure during the period of the next mid-range plan, we currently assume that we will be able to keep it to approximately 70% to 80% of the current mid-range plan period by taking full advantage of our existing production facilities and strategic inventory. • In the Financial Services segment, we were able to obtain approval for the corporate restructuring plan for a partial spin-off under the Act on Strengthening Industrial Competitiveness of Japan. Based on this approval, we are working in earnest to prepare for the spin-off and listing of the shares of Sony Financial Group Inc. in October 2025. • Thatʼs all for the explanation. 2122Notes Notes about Adjusted OIBDAand Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted EBITDAare calculated by the following formulas: Adjusted OIBDA = Operating income + Depreciation and amortization expense* -the profit and loss amount that Sony deems non-recurring Adjusted EBITDA= Net income attributable to Sony Group Corporationʼs stockholders + Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests + Income taxes + Interest expenses, net, recorded in Financial income and Financial expense -Gain on revaluation of equity instruments, net, recorded in Financial income and Financial expense + Depreciation and amortization expense* -the profit and loss amount that Sony deems non-recurring In the above formulas, depreciation and amortization expense excludes amortization for film costs and broadcasting rights, as well as forinternally developed game content and master recordings included in Content assets. Adjusted OIBDAand Adjusted EBITDA are not measures in accordance with IFRS. However, Sony believes that these disclosures may be useful information to investors. Adjusted OIBDAand Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, Sonyʼs results in accordance with IFRS. Sales on a Constant Currency Basis and the Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations The descriptions of sales on a constant currency basis reflect sales calculated by applying the yenʼs monthly average exchange rates from the same period of the previous fiscal year to local currency-denominated monthly sales in the relevant period of the current fiscal year. For Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Music Publishing LLC in the Music segment, and in thePictures segment,the constant currency amounts are calculated by applying the monthly average U.S. dollar / yen exchange rates after aggregation on a U.S. dollar basis. Results for the Pictures segment are described on a U.S. dollar basis as the Pictures segment reflects the operations of SonyPictures Entertainment Inc. , a U.S.-based operation that aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries in U.S. dollars. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on sales is calculated by applying the change in the yenʼs periodic weightedaverage exchange rate for the same period of the previous fiscal year from the relevant period of the current fiscal year to the major transactional currencies in which the sales are denominated. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating income is calculated by subtracting from the impact on sales the impact on cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses calculated by applying the same major transactional currencies calculation process to cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses as for the impact on sales. The I&SS segment enters into its own foreign exchange hedging transactions, and the impact of those transactions is included in the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on sales and operating income for that segment. This information is not a substitute for Sonyʼs consolidated financial statements and condensed consolidated financial statements measured in accordance with IFRS. However, Sony believes that these disclosures provide additional useful analytical information to investors regarding the operating performance of Sony. Notes about Financial Performance of the Music, Pictures and Financial Services segments The Music segment results include the yen-based results of Sony Music Entertainment Inc. and the yen-translated results of SME and SMP, which aggregate the results of their worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. The Pictures segment results are the yen-translated results of SPE, which aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Management analyzes the results of SPE in U.S. dollars, so discussion of certain portions of its results is specified as being on “a U.S. dollar basis”. The Financial Services segment results include Sony Financial Group Inc. and SFGIʼs consolidated subsidiaries such as Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Sony Assurance Inc., and Sony Bank Inc. The results discussed in the Financial Services segment differ from the results that SFGI and SFGIʼs consolidated subsidiaries disclose separately on a Japanese statutory basis. 23Cautionary Statement Statements made in this presentation with respect to Sonyʼs current plans, estimates, strategies and beliefs and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements about the future performance of Sony.
