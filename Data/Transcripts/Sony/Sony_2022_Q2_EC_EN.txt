Operating income excluding this amount is estimated to be billion yen. 7Current State of the Business ©Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. All rights reserved. Design and specifications are subject to change without notice. • Although total gameplay time spent by PlayStation users during Q2 increased slightly versus the previous quarter, it decreased 10% year-on-year primarily due to the impact of an increase in opportunities to go outside resulting from a reduction in COVID-19 infections. • When we compare software sales for this quarter with the same period of the previous fiscal year, we see sales of past library titles declined sharply, while sales of major new titles remained strong. Users appear to be playing a smaller number of titles out of a desire to spend less money. • The number of PlayStation Plus subscriber accounts at the end of September decreased 4% from the end of June to 45.4 million accounts. We see that this decrease results from a greater decline in user engagement among PlayStation users than expected. • On the other hand, the ratio of PS Plus subscribers among PlayStation users remains at a level significantly higher than that of PS4. We are putting even more effort into accelerating the penetration of PS5 hardware to recover this user engagement going forward. 8FY22 Q2 PS5 Units Produced 6.5 million over © Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. All rights reserved. Design and specifications are subject to change without notice. • Regarding production of PS5 hardware, restrictions on the supply of materials and logistics have significantly eased, and the number of units produced during the quarter exceeded 6.5 million, progressing faster than planned. • We recognize that demand from customers for the PS5 continues to be strong as the actual sales situation at retail stores in the U.S. is such that, in September, it took an average of 17.5 hours to sell out of thousand units after their arrival. • To meet this strong demand, we will do our utmost to bring forward supply into the year-end holiday selling season and aim to exceed our FY22 forecast of million units. 9Software Business ©Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. All rights reserved. Design and specifications are subject to change without notice. 0 • In terms of first-party software, we plan to release a new popular franchise title, God of War Ragnarok, on November 9. • The previous God of War game released in was one of the biggest titles ever released exclusively for PlayStation, selling million units cumulative to date. We expect similar performance from this new title as well. • Regarding Bungie, Destiny 2: The Witch Queen Season of Plunder, which was released in August, is off to a good start. In addition, we have announced Destiny 2: Lightfall, which is an expansion pack scheduled for release in February of next year, and we are receiving great expectations from fans as a result. • In addition, Bungieʼs collaboration with PlayStation Studios is progressing well. • Regarding PC software, we released Marvelʼs Spider-Man in August and the popular IP that was also a hit movie, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection ,in October. • These titles have been rated highly with Metacritic Metascores of and respectively, and, in the two months since release, sales of Marvelʼs Spider-Man approached the highest level ever for a PC software title released by Sony. 10Current State of the Business ©Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc.

These acquisitions perform the important role of generating stable, long-term royalty income, further expanding song revenue opportunities, and increasing our presence in the music industry. • These strategic investments are steadily producing results, and we expect operating income this fiscal year of Sony Music Group, which is responsible for our music business outside of Japan, to reach a record high for the sixth consecutive year. 14Pictures Segment SalesandOperatingIncome Q2FY2022 Sales The following analysis is on a U.S. dollar basis OperatingIncome Sales: 76.8 blnyen significant increase 337.5 · Higher revenues for films released theatrically in FY22 in Motion Pictures 260.7 · Higher television licensing and home entertainment revenues for titles released in FY21 in Motion Pictures · Higher revenues for anime streaming services, including the impact of the acquisition of Crunchyroll · Impact of the acquisition of Industrial Media 31.6 27.6 · Absence of new films licensed to digital streaming services in Motion Pictures Q2 FY21 Q2 FY22 · Decrease in series deliveries for Television Productions OI: 4.0 blnyen decrease · Impact of absence of new films licensed to digital streaming services in Motion Pictures · Increase in marketing costs to support current year theatrical releases 1,380 1,450 · Impact of above-mentioned increase in sales 1,238.9 FY2022Forecast Sales:70blnyenupwardrevision · Impact of foreign exchange rates 217.4 OI:15blnyenupwardrevision 115 · Higher contribution from catalog product in Television Productions · Higher contribution from catalog product inMotion Pictures · Positive impact of foreign exchange rates FY21 FY22 FY22 July FCT November FCT • Next is the Pictures segment. • Q2 sales increased 29% year-on-year to 337.5 billion yen primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. • Operating income decreased 4.0 billion yen year-on-year to 27.6 billion yen primarily due to the existence, in the same period of the previous fiscal year, of licensing revenues from digital streaming services for new films. • FY22 sales are expected to be trillion billion yen, an increase of billion yen from the previous forecast primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. • We have upwardly revised the operating income forecast to billion yen, an increase of billion yen compared to the previous forecast, primarily due to the contribution of catalogue product in Television Productions and Motion Pictures, as well as the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 15Major Theatrical Releases in Q2 FY2022 Action/Comedy/Thriller Drama/Mystery/Thriller Action/Drama/History ©2022 Sony Pictures Entertainment All Rights Reserved. • In Motion Pictures, as you can see, Sony released original works in different genres during the quarter, and all of them performed well. • Among them was Where the Crawdads Sing, a movie adaptation of a best-selling novel which achieved box office revenue that greatly exceeded our expectations. The movie was made by Pictures, a studio of Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has a partnership with Harper Collins, a major global publishing company.

This enabled us to recover sales and profit primarily in the digital camera space. • On the other hand, for TVs, the deterioration of the business environment is becoming apparent, such as increasing downward pressure on prices due to an oversupply of panels and sluggish demand especially in Europe. • We anticipate that the environment will become even more severe going into next fiscal year due to the global economic slowdown and we are trying to minimize risks by strengthening integrated operations from production to sales and thoroughly controlling costs. • As of the end of September, daily turnover of inventory in every product category has decreased versus the end of June and we are paying close attention to demand trends as we reduce inventory even further toward the end of the year. • In addition, we are accelerating our efforts to strengthen our business structure from next fiscal year onwards through such measures as automation of production and digitization of manufacturing and sales operations, strengthening the cooperation between ET&S and I&SS and G&NS in procurement and logistics, and further optimization of the break- even point according to the business environment. • In addition, new business areas which have been positioned as our growth axis, such as sports, life sciences, network services and virtual production, are expected to increase their sales by approximately 20% from the previous fiscal year and we will continue to steadily promote a shift to businesses that generate stable sales and profit. 21Imaging & Sensing Solutions Segment Salesand OperatingIncome Sales Q2FY2022 OperatingIncome Sales:120.1blnyensignificantincrease 398.4 ·Impact of foreign exchange rates ·Increase in sales of image sensors for mobile products · Improvement in product mix 278.3 · Decrease in unit sales 74.0 OI:24.3blnyensignificantincrease 49.7 ·Positive impact of foreign exchange rates ·Impact of increase in sales of image sensors for mobile products ·Increase in research and development expenses as well as depreciation and amortization expenses Q2 FY21 Q2 FY22 ·Increase in manufacturing costs 1,440 1,440 FY2022Forecast Sales:RemainsunchangedfromJulyforecast 1,076.4 · Impact of foreign exchange rates ·Decreaseinunit sales of image sensors for mobile products ·Decrease in unit sales of image sensors for industrial equipment and security cameras 220 155.6 OI:20blnyenupwardrevision ·Positive impact of foreign exchange rates ·Impact of decrease in sales of image sensors FY21 FY22 FY22 JulyFCT NovemberFCT • Next is the Imaging & Sensing Solutions segment. • Q2 sales increased a significant 43% year-on-year to 398.4 billion yen, mainly due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and higher sales of image sensors for mobile devices. • Operating income was 74.0 billion yen, a significant increase of 24.3 billion yen year-on-year, mainly due to the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and the benefit from the increase in sales, despite increases in research and development and other expenses. • Our FY22 sales forecast remains unchanged from the previous forecast. • We have upwardly revised our operating income forecast by billion yen from the previous forecast to billion yen primarily due to the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. 22Current State of the Business 3 • The slowdown in the smartphone market, particularly in China, did not improve during Q2, but the impact was generally within the scope assumed in our previous forecast. • On the other hand, high-end smartphone cameras are progressing as expected with larger die-sizes, higher resolution and higher performance. Benefitting from this, sales reached an historic high for this segment in the second quarter. • Due to the improved supply of logic semiconductors, it has become possible to increase the production of larger die-sizes and higher resolution sensors, which means that we can pro-actively introduce high value-added sensors to high-end products going forward. • We expect image sensor shipments in the third quarter ending , to remain at a high level, but we also believe that we need to consider the risk of a further economic slowdown in the end-user product market in the fourth quarter ending . Therefore, in the current forecast, we have incorporated additional risks into our sales plan, and we have made a conservative forecast. • Regarding inventories, we are continuing to utilize existing production capacity and manage strategic inventories to optimize the timing of future capital investment, while carefully examining the demand outlook for the next fiscal year. • Inventory at the end of the quarter was up about 33% year-on-year, which we believe is broadly in line with sales growth for the year. • From the next fiscal year onwards, we expect the trend of increasing adoption of large die-sizes and higher resolution sensors in high-end smartphones to drive the growth of this segment. At the same time, the automotive business is also steadily expanding, and we have great expectations for this business to grow over the medium- to long-term. 23Financial Services Segment Financial Services Revenueand OperatingIncome F Oi pn ea rn ac ti ia nl g S Ie nr cv oic mes e Revenue Q2FY2022 Revenue:63.9blnyensignificantdecrease 368.4 · Significant decrease in revenue at Sony Life (71.6 blnyen decrease, 304.5 revenue: 251.8 blnyen) · Deteriorationin net gains and losses on investments in the separate accounts OI:11.6blnyensignificantincrease 54.6 · Recovery of an unauthorized withdrawal of funds at a subsidiary of 43.1 Sony Life in FY21 · Significant decrease in OI at Sony Life (12.4 blnyen decrease, OI: 26.3 blnyen) Q2 FY21 Q2 FY22 ·Increase primarily in insurance paymentsrelated to COVID-19 ·Increase in profits due to accumulation of policy amount in force 1,533.8 1,440 FY2022Forecast 1,310 Revenue: blnyen downward revision · Deterioration in net gains and losses on investments in the separate accounts at Sony Life  OI: Remains unchanged from July forecast 220 150.1 FY21 FY22 FY22 JulyFCT November FCT • Last is the Financial Services segment. • FY22 Q2 financial services revenue decreased 17% year-on-year to 304.5 billion yen, mainly due to a deterioration in net gains and losses on investments in the separate accounts at Sony Life Insurance Ltd. . • Operating income at Sony Life increased a significant 11.6 billion yen year-on-year to 54.6 billion yen, primarily due to the impact of the recovery of funds that were the subject of an unauthorized withdrawal and the recording of losses in the previous fiscal year, partially offset primarily by an increase in insurance payments related to COVID-19. • The FY22 financial services revenue forecast is trillion billion yen, a decrease of billion yen from the previous forecast, primarily reflecting the deterioration in net gains and losses on investments in the separate accounts at Sony Life. • There is no change from the previous forecast for operating income. 24• To summarize this earnings announcement, first of all, our biggest regret is that we have made a significant downward revision to the operating income forecast of the G&NS segment for the second consecutive quarter in a row. • As CFO, I take this very seriously, and I view improving the accuracy of our earnings forecasts as an important goal. • On the other hand, when looking at the entire group, in the first half of the fiscal year, we think that each business responded swiftly to major changes in the business environment. • Furthermore, the results of the investments we have made in the Music and I&SS segments have made up for the weakness of the G&NS segment and the cost structure of each business segment has balanced out the significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Due to these factors, we think that we have stabilized the sales and profit of the whole group through our diversified business portfolio and think that we have enhanced our resiliency. • We anticipate that the business environment will become even more severe from now into next fiscal year, and each business is taking steps to prepare for this. • In addition, while facing these issues in the short term, we will also work to implement measures to grow over the long term. • That concludes my remarks. 25Notes Sales on a Constant Currency Basis and the Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations The descriptions of sales on a constant currency basis reflect sales calculated by applying the yenʼs monthly average exchange rates from the same period of the previous fiscal year to local currency-denominated monthly sales in the relevant period of the current fiscal year. For Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Music Publishing LLC in the Music segment, and in thePictures segment,the constant currency amounts are calculated by applying the monthly average U.S. dollar / yen exchange rates after aggregation on a U.S. dollar basis. Results for the Pictures segment are described on a U.S. dollar basis as the Pictures segment reflects the operations of SonyPictures Entertainment Inc. , a U.S.-based operation that aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries in U.S. dollars. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on sales is calculated by applying the change in the yenʼs periodic weightedaverage exchange rate for the same period of the previous fiscal year from the relevant period of the current fiscal year to the major transactional currencies in which the sales are denominated. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating income is calculated by subtracting from the impact on salesthe impact on cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses calculated by applying the same major transactional currencies calculation process to cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses as for the impact on sales. The I&SS segment enters into its own foreign exchange hedging transactions, and the impact of those transactions is included in the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on sales and operating income for thatsegment. This information is not a substitute for Sonyʼs consolidated financial statements measured in accordance with IFRS. However,Sony believes that these disclosures provide additional useful analytical information to investors regarding the operating performance of Sony. Notes about Financial Performance of the Music, Pictures and Financial Services segments The Music segment results include the yen-based results of Sony Music Entertainment Inc. and the yen-translated results of SME and SMP, which aggregate the results of their worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. The Pictures segment results are the yen-translated results of SPE, which aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Management analyzes the results of SPE in U.S. dollars, so discussion of certain portions of its results is specified as being on “a U.S. dollar basis”. The Financial Services segment results include Sony Financial Group Inc. and SFGIʼs consolidated subsidiaries such as Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd. , Sony Assurance Inc., and Sony Bank Inc. The results of Sony Life discussed in the Financial Services segment differ from the results that SFGI and SFGIʼsconsolidated subsidiaries disclose separately on a Japanese statutory basis. 26Cautionary Statement Statements made in this presentation with respect to Sonyʼs current plans, estimates, strategies and beliefs and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements about the future performance of Sony.
