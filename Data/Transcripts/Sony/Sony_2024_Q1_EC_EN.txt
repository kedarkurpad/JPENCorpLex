This has accelerated the expansion of the high-end smartphone market, which has led to further progress of the expansion of the size of the sensors we ship.  As such, the market environment is progressing generally in-line with our previous forecast.  From the second quarter onwards, we expect the trend towards larger sensors for ultra-wide-angle and telephoto cameras to continue. We believe that this trend, together with improved sensor performance to improve camera video capabilities, will be medium- term growth drivers for the mobile sensor market.  In terms of production, improvements in yields for mobile sensors are progressing as planned in May, and we aim to achieve a normal run rate during this fiscal year.  Additionally, we will aim to make maximum use of existing production capacity and be selective in making new investments. Together with other development and operational efficiency measures, we intend to work to improve profitability, a key theme of this mid-range plan. 19Financial Services Segment Financial Services Revenue, Q1FY2024 OperatingIncome and Adjusted OIBDA Revenue:232.8blnyensignificantdecrease FinancialServicesRevenue · Significant decrease in revenue at Sony Life OperatingIncome AdjustedOIBDA · Decrease in net gains on investments related to market fluctuations in the separate accounts 681.4 OI: 24.5 blnyen significant decrease 448.6 / Adjusted OIBDA: 24.6 blnyen significant decrease · Significant decrease in OI at Sony Life 54.561.4 30.036.8 ·.

Adjusted OIBDAand Adjusted EBITDA are not measures in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. However, Sony believes that these disclosures may be useful information to investors. Adjusted OIBDAand Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, Sonyʼs results in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. Sales on a Constant Currency Basis and the Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations The descriptions of sales on a constant currency basis reflect sales calculated by applying the yenʼs monthly average exchange rates from the same period of the previous fiscal year to local currency-denominated monthly sales in the relevant period of the current fiscal year. For Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Music Publishing LLC in the Music segment, and in thePictures segment,the constant currency amounts are calculated by applying the monthly average U.S. dollar / yen exchange rates after aggregation on a U.S. dollar basis. Results for the Pictures segment are described on a U.S. dollar basis as the Pictures segment reflects the operations of SonyPictures Entertainment Inc. , a U.S.-based operation that aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries in U.S. dollars. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on sales is calculated by applying the change in the yenʼs periodic weightedaverage exchange rate for the same period of the previous fiscal year from the relevant period of the current fiscal year to the major transactional currencies in which the sales are denominated. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating income is calculated by subtracting from the impact on sales the impact on cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses calculated by applying the same major transactional currencies calculation process to cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses as for the impact on sales. The I&SS segment enters into its own foreign exchange hedging transactions, and the impact of those transactions is included in the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on sales and operating income for that segment. This information is not a substitute for Sonyʼs consolidated financial statements and condensed consolidated financial statements measured in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. However, Sony believes that these disclosures provide additional useful analytical information to investors regarding the operating performance of Sony. Notes about Financial Performance of the Music, Pictures and Financial Services segments The Music segment results include the yen-based results of Sony Music Entertainment Inc. and the yen-translated results of SME and SMP, which aggregate the results of their worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. The Pictures segment results are the yen-translated results of SPE, which aggregates the results of its worldwide subsidiaries on a U.S. dollar basis. Management analyzes the results of SPE in U.S. dollars, so discussion of certain portions of its results is specified as being on “a U.S. dollar basis”. The Financial Services segment results include SFGI and SFGIʼs consolidated subsidiaries such as Sony Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Sony Assurance Inc., and Sony Bank Inc. The results discussed in the Financial Services segment differ from the results that SFGI and SFGIʼs consolidated subsidiaries disclose separately on a Japanese statutory basis. 27Cautionary Statement Statements made in this material with respect to Sonyʼs current plans, estimates, strategies and beliefs and other statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements about the future performance of Sony.
