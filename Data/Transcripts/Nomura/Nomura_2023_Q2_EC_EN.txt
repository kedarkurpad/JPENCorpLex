1Good evening, this is Takumi Kitamura, CFO of Nomura Holdings. I will now give you an overview of our financial results for the second quarter and first half of the fiscal year ending March using the document titled Consolidated Results of Operations. Please turn to page two. Net revenue for the six months to September was billion yen, a decline of percent year on year. Income before income taxes was 43.2 billion yen, down percent compared to last year. Net income declined percent to 18.5 billion yen. As shown on the bottom right, three segment income before income taxes was 49.7 billion yen. Market uncertainty continued during the six months period as the yen depreciated rapidly due to monetary tightening and a widening of the interest rate differential between Japan and the US and due to concerns of a recession. Sentiment among Retail clients worsened and slow sales of stocks and investment trusts meant flow revenues dropped significantly. Investment gain/loss in Investment Management was negatively impacted by mark-to-market valuations of shareholdings due to worse market conditions and also because the same period last year included revenue contributions from an IPO of an investee company. As a result, both divisions reported lower results compared to the same period last year. However, in both divisions we are seeing progress in our efforts to increase assets over the medium to long term. Despite the market headwinds, Retail recurring revenue and Investment Management business revenue both grew year on year. Wholesale performance rebounded during the first six months. Fixed Income reported stronger client flows on the back of heightened interest rate and FX volatility, resulting in revenue growth driven by Macro Products. The absence of losses related to transactions with a US client last year also contributed to improved performance. Segment Other was roughly unchanged from last year. An unrealized loss of billion yen was booked due to a decline in share prices of securities held for operating purposes. That concludes the overview of our first half results. In terms of shareholder returns, we announced a half-year dividend of yen per share for shareholders of record as of the end of September. Let’s now take a look at performance in the second quarter. Please turn to page three. All percentage comparisons I mention here are quarter on quarter. 2Net revenue was billion yen, up percent. Income before income taxes was 31.5 billion yen and net income was 16.8 billion yen, both representing improvements from last quarter. While the market uncertainty had an impact, this performance is far from satisfactory. EPS was 5.41 yen and ROE was 2.2 percent. Three segment income before income taxes, which represents our core businesses, was 31.2 billion yen, an increase of percent as Investment Management investment gain/loss improved. Let’s now take a look at second quarter business performance. Please turn to page six for Retail. 345Net revenue increased percent to 72.5 billion yen, while income before income taxes grew percent to 5.5 billion yen. As shown on the bottom left, recurring revenue was 33.9 billion yen, up percent on ongoing net inflows of recurring revenue assets driven by discretionary investments and loans. Disciplined cost control resulted in a recurring revenue cost coverage ratio of percent, marking the first time it was above percent. Flow revenue was flat at 38.6 billion yen. Market uncertainty impacted investor sentiment, leading to a slowdown in sales of investment trusts and foreign stocks. However, we are making progress in asset consulting. Consulting-related revenue, which is included in flow revenue, grew by percent driven by insurance, real estate and advisory services. Page seven show sales by product. 6Total sales slipped percent in the quarter to 4.6 trillion yen. For investment trusts, the donation scheme of the ESG fund Nomura Sustainable Select launched in July gained support spreading across Japan. While global equity funds also saw inflows, total sales of investment trusts declined percent due to weaker investor sentiment. On the other hand, sales of stocks, shown in red, increased by percent. Primary transactions were virtually non-existent and sales of foreign stocks slowed, but sales of domestic stocks grew by over percent on the back of a market rebound in August and buying opportunity in September as the market turned bearish. Please turn to page eight for an update of KPIs. 7Net inflows of recurring revenue assets shown on the top left as 127.9 billion yen. As you can see on the top right, recurring revenue assets at the end of September had dropped to 18.3 trillion yen, but the quarterly average actually increased and recurring revenue remained resilient after bottoming out in the fourth quarter. The bottom right shows number of services for salaried employees increase to 3.45 million, representing steady progress towards our KPI. ESOP in particular is growing and we are seeing cases of ESOPs being transferred to us given the good reputation of our services and systems. Participant numbers are also increasing as we make various proposals and provide information. Please turn to page nine for an overview of Investment Management. 8Net revenue was 26.2 billion yen and income before income taxes was 5.6 billion yen, both improving from last quarter. Investment gain/loss, which has had a significant impact on performance over the past two quarters, improved to negative 3.7 billion yen as ACI related loss narrowed and unrealized gain/loss on investee companies of Nomura Capital Partners improved. Business revenue remained stable at 29.9 billion yen. The asset management business was solid booking inflows into both the investment trust and investment advisory businesses, resulting in asset management fees similar to last quarter. This quarter there was no contribution from performance fees due to issues around the timing of calculations. Please turn to page 10. 9As shown on the top left, assets under management at the end of September were 64.8 trillion yen, down by billion yen from end of June due mainly to market factors. Average AuMfor July to September remained high at 66.2 trillion yen. Net inflows shown on the bottom left was billion yen for the investment trust business. MRFs, where individuals park their idle funds, reported outflows of billion yen as these funds were likely used to make new purchases during the market correction. Core investment trusts saw inflows of billion yen and we also booked inflows through the Nomura Securities channel from publicly offered fund investing in US unlisted REITs and ESG fund. The bank channel and DC funds also reported ongoing inflows. The investment advisory business posted inflows of billion yen. In Japan, we booked inflows into alternatives, while internationally into equity funds. As shown on the bottom right, alternative assets under management exceeded 1.2 trillion yen and we are making progress in our push into private markets. Please turn to page for an overview of Wholesale performance. 10Net revenue increased percent to 205.5 billion yen. Fixed Income had a good quarter driven by Macro Products, Investment Banking performance improved and the weaker yen also contributed. Expenses increased to 185.3 billion yen. While we were able to contain variable costs such as pay for performance bonuses and commissions and floor brokerage, the sharp depreciation of the yen and an increase in various expenses such as business development lead to higher expenses overall. As a result, income before income taxes declined percent to 20.2 billion yen. Please turn to page for an overview of results by business line. 11Global Markets net revenue was roughly unchanged from last quarter at 177.5 billion yen. Fixed Income net revenue increased percent to 115.6 billion yen. Macro Products had another good quarter with AEJ FX/EM posting its strongest quarterly revenues in six and a half years. Spread Products saw a slight slowdown in Securitized Products, while Credit remained solid. Equities net revenue remained sluggish at 61.9 billion yen amid the ongoing uncertainty. Equity Products revenues were flat, while Execution Services slowed slightly as market volumes declined. Please turn to page for Investment Banking. 12Net revenue increased percent to billion yen. Sustainability-related and cross-border transactions contributed to the Advisory business which delivered stronger revenues in Japan, EMEA and AEJ. We worked on multiple private placement transactions such as for GRIDSERVE Sustainable Energy shown on the top left of the right hand side. ECM was slow as corporates shied away from fundraising and IPOs, but DCM delivered revenues in line with last quarter as we executed multiple sustainability-related bond issuances. Demand for solutions such as equities, rates, and FX is on the rise reflecting current volatile market conditions. Now, let’s turn to expenses on page 14. 13Groupwidenon-interest expenses were roughly flat at 286.5 billion yen. Overall costs were up due to yen depreciation, while Other expenses declined by percent due to lower legal expenses. Page gives you an overview of our financial position. 14As shown on the bottom left, our Tier capital was 3.3 trillion yen, an increase of over billion yen from the end of June driven mainly by an increase in FX translation adjustment due to the weaker yen. Risk-weighted assets increased by billion yen from the end of June to 17.2 trillion yen. As you can see in the waterfall graph on the bottom right, credit risk increased by billion yen, mostly due to yen depreciation. As a result, our Tier capital ratio at the end of September was percent and our CET ratio was 16.8 percent, both in line with last quarter. That concludes today’s overview of our second quarter results. This quarter was challenging given the market uncertainty. But as I said at the start, each of our businesses is steadily moving forward with their strategic initiatives. Retail has started a program sponsored by the Head of Retail and myself as CFO to improve revenues and revise the cost structure. We have gained an understanding of the detailed strategy and numbers for each segment and identified areas for cost reductions. We aim to boost revenues through this project. The market uncertainty remained through October and we are yet to see a full rebound in performance. However, our Retail channel is delivering strong growth in sales of USD bonds in terms of transactions and value through successful product marketing that taps into market movements. In Wholesale, our financing businesses faced a challenging environment, but Macro Products in Fixed Income and our Advisory and Solutions businesses in Investment Banking made revenue contributions and overall we were able to benefit from portfolio diversification. We also tapped into volatility around rates and FX. Sales of foreign bonds to Japanese institutional investors and investments in yen bonds by international investors both increased from the prior year. In October we saw a pause in US interest rate hikes and the strengthening dollar and our trading business was generally slow, but from November we have several events including the US midterm elections and the FOMC meeting, so we see revenue opportunities ahead as volatility returns. While the market uncertainty is expected to continue for now, we will continue to stringently manage risks while providing liquidity and solutions to our clients. Thank you. 1516171819202122232425262728293031
