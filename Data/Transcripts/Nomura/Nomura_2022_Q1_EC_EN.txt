Good evening, this is Takumi Kitamura, CFO of Nomura Holdings. I will now give you an overview of our financial results for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March using the document titled Consolidated Results of Operations. Please turn to page two. Net revenue increased percent quarter on quarter to 353.3 billion yen, while income before income taxes improved to 78.5 billion yen as shown on the top right. Three segment income before income taxes was 35.6 billion yen, recovering from a loss last quarter due to two main reasons. First, Investment Management established in April this year made a significant contribution, and second Wholesale performance improved. Wholesale performance was again impacted this quarter by transactions with a US client last quarter, but we exited all our positions in May. Fixed Income revenue grew quarter on quarter, while strong momentum in Investment Banking continued. Segment Other income before income taxes was 39.6 billion yen, representing an increase of around billion yen from last quarter’s loss. Last quarter we also booked an impairment charge of 47.7 billion yen in Nomura Real Estate Holdings. That was no longer present this quarter and in June we booked a realized gain of 36.2 billion yen from the sale of part of our stake in Nomura Research Institute. Net income was 48.5 billion yen, annualized ROE was 7.1 percent and EPS was 15.59 yen. Now, let’s take a closer look at each business, starting with Retail on page 5.1234Retail first quarter net revenue declined percent to billion yen, while income before income taxes down percent to billion yen. Retail clients remained on the sidelines due to another wave of the pandemic and a slump in equity markets in early May, pushing down sales of stocks and investment trusts. Despite this, we continued to make progress in our efforts to expand client assets. As shown on the top right, net inflows of cash and securities was positive billion yen, and Retail client assets hit a record trillion yen. 5The top right of page shows investment trust net inflows of 89.2 billion yen, representing another quarter of net purchases. Discretionary investments had been trending down for a while, but that started bottoming out in November last year when we introduced CIO services and this quarter we reported net inflows of 78.5 billion yen. This combined with market factors to lift recurring revenue assets to 19.1 trillion yen and recurring revenue to 25.2 billion yen, marking the highest levels since we started monitoring these indicators. Growth of consulting-related revenue, shown on the bottom left, was sluggish given the restrictions on face-to-face services, but the number of active clients, shown to the bottom right, is trending smoothly at 500,000. Please turn to page 7. 6As you may know, we dissolved the Asset Management and Merchant Banking divisions and created the new Investment Management division on April 1. The graph on the top left here shows a reclassification of past figures under the new disclosure format to make it easier for comparisons. Business revenue includes relatively stable revenues such as from the Asset Management business and Nomura Babcock & Brown’s aircraft leasing business. Investment gain/loss includes gain/loss related to American Century Investments, private equity investment gain/loss, and mark-to-market gain/loss for securities held under Investment Management. As such, this figure is subject to fluctuation depending on changes in fair value and investment exits. First quarter net revenue in Investment Management increased percent to 63.5 billion yen, while income before income taxes grew percent to 44.9 billion yen. This performance was driven by investment gain/loss which came in at 35.5 billion yen, a percent rise over last quarter. We booked a total of billion yen in realized and unrealized gains on the IPO of a Nomura Capital Partners investee company at the end of June. ACI related gain/loss contributed around billion yen this quarter. Business revenue was down percent at billion yen. In the January to March quarter, there was an overlap in the timing of recognizing performance fees, which meant there was extra performance fees booked last quarter. As shown on the bottom left, inflows boosted assets under management to a record high of 65.8 trillion yen and asset management fees increased. Please turn to page 8. 7The graph on the top left shows inflows into our investment trust business and the investment advisory and international business, giving total inflows of billion yen. A breakdown for the investment trust business is shown on the bottom left. Core investment trust flows, which exclude ETFs and MRFs, had been negative through to last quarter, but turned positive this quarter, due partly to the bank channel shown on the top right. Inflows this quarter centered on ESG-related products, and Wealth Square, which provides fund wraps, saw an increase in assets under management. The graph on the bottom right shows alternative assets under management, which have grown steadily and were at billion yen at the end of June.

As I said earlier, performance was significantly impacted by an additional loss of 65.4 billion yen arising from transactions with a US client. Of this, 56.1 billion yen was booked as a trading loss in Equities revenues and the remaining 9.3 billion yen was booked as loan loss provisions in expenses. The regional breakdown of net revenue on the bottom left shows the Americas was largely affected. While revenues in Japan and AEJ slowed quarter on quarter, EMEA delivered steady revenues driven by Rates. Please turn to page for a breakdown by business line. 9Global Markets net revenue improved from last quarter to 97.2 billion yen, declining percent excluding the trading loss related to transactions with a US client. Cash Equities and Derivatives both slowed due to a drop in volatility and lower trading volumes. As the heat map on the top right shows, AEJ and Japan are both pointing down. Fixed Income revenues increased to 88.1 billion yen driven by spread products such as Credit and Securitized Products. The heat map shows strong performance in Securitized Products in the Americas and higher Credit revenues in Japan as we tapped into the demand for yield. AEJ Credit had a good quarter but FX/EM slowed and the arrow is pointing down. Next, Investment Banking. Please turn to page 11. 10Net revenue was 35.5 billion yen, marking the third strong quarter with revenues over billion yen. M&A had another strong quarter and we supported multiple cross-border and sustainability-related deals driven by Nomura Greentech. ECM and DCM revenues also increased. Key deals are shown on the right. We supported a diverse range of fundraising this quarter. We are seeing results from strategic alliances shown on the bottom right. We won multiple co-lead manager mandates in Americas ECM through alliance with Wolfe Research. Our alliance with Jarden in Australia and New Zealand announced in May got off to a good start as we executed the first deal already. Please turn to page for an overview of non-interest expenses. 11Total non-interest expenses declined percent to 274.7 billion yen. Other expenses dropped by about billion yen to 48.2 billion yen as loan loss provisions related to a US client transactions declined by billion yen and the 47.7 billion yen impairment charge on an affiliate booked last quarter was not present this quarter. Compensation and benefits rose about percent in line with pay for performance. Please turn to page for our financial position. 12The table on the bottom left show Tier capital at trillion yen, up billion yen from the end of March due mainly to higher retained earnings and the issuance of Additional Tier bonds. Risk-weighted assets declined 1.2 trillion yen from the end of March to 14.7 trillion yen as market risk declined due to a drop in volatility and we stringently risk managed our positions, and also due to lower credit risk. As a result, our June-end Tier capital ratio was 20.3 percent and CET1 ratio was 17.7 percent, both improving markedly. That concludes today’s overview of our first quarter financial results. 13To conclude, this quarter saw a number of positives despite slowing from the year ended March 2021. Investment Management newly established in Aprilplaysa key roleon our strategy to expand into private markets and this quarter a private equity investee company listed and we saw a strong contributiontoearnings. Retail reported a decline in brokerage fees due to the market, but investment trusts and discretionary investments grew each month and recurring revenue reach a record high.
