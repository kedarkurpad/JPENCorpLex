Good evening, this is Takumi Kitamura, CFO of Nomura Holdings. First, I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to those affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake and pray for a swift recovery from this disaster. I will now give you an overview of our financial results for the third quarter of the fiscal year ending March using the document titled Consolidated Results of Operations. Please turn to page two.1Group net revenue increased percent quarter on quarter to 400.2 billion yen, while income before income taxes grew percent to 78.7 billion yen. Net income was up percent at 50.5 billion yen and as you can see on the top right, performance bottomed out in the fourth quarter last year and has continued to improve since then. The third quarter proved to be somewhat of an emotional rollercoaster for market participants over the possibility of the FRB moving away from its tightening stance. This combined with tensions in the Middle East resulting in elevated volatility in equity markets and heightened uncertainty. Inflation in the US slowed towards the end of the quarter, raising hopes of an exit from the sharp rate hikes over the past two years and driving robust performance in equity markets. In fixed income markets, we also started to see a recovery in the issuance of securitized product as interest rates fell and credit spreads tightened. Interest in Japan remained high. Activity picked up among not only institutional investors, but also corporates and individuals over expectations of a monetary policy shift, various actions by corporates to improve capital efficiency and reduce strategic shareholdings, and investment momentum in the lead up to the introduction of the new NISA scheme. Amid this environment, we played to our strengths by fully leveraging our extensive client franchise in Japan and our global network to deliver products, services and solutions tailored to the needs of our clients. This resulted in strong momentum across our three core businesses. Before I go into the details of performance of each business, please take a look at the bottom right which shows three segment income before income taxes of 70.5 billion yen, up percent over last quarter. Our international Wholesale business reported an uptick in client activity towards the end of the quarter and all international regions had a profitable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was 16.1 yen and return on equity was 6.2 percent. While this represents a positive trend towards improved performance, we are still not where we want to be. With this momentum in performance and given our sufficient capital base, today we resolved to set up a share buyback program in order to raise capital efficiency and ensure a flexible capital management policy, and to deliver shares on exercise of stock-based compensation. The program will run from February to September and have an upper limit of million shares with the upper limit of the aggregate amount of the repurchase price being billion yen. Please turn to page three for an update of results for the nine months to December. 2Net revenue for the period was 1,116.9 billion yen, up percent compared to the same period last year. Income before income taxes increased percent to 181.8 billion yen, while net income grew percent to 109.1 billion yen. EPS was 34.69 yen and ROE was 4.5 percent. As shown on the right-hand side, three segment income before income taxes rose percent to 159.7 billion yen. Income before income taxes in Retail jumped 3.5 times and in Investment Management, it increased percent. Now, I will turn to business performance in the third quarter, starting with Retail on page six. All the percentages I mention from now refer to changes compared to the second quarter. 345Retail net revenue increased percent to 102.6 billion yen and income before income taxes was 31.9 billion yen, marking the highest level in eight years since the July to September quarter in 2015. The reallocation of our Partners last Spring has delivered steady results and we are starting to see good signs in terms of the quality and quantity of our dialogue with clients. As you can see on the bottom left, flow revenue increased percent to billion yen, spurred on by strong equity-related revenues due to favorable market conditions and primary transactions such as the offering by Denso. For recurring revenue, an area of strategic focus, we reported results in line with last quarter’s record high. Although revenues were up percent, expenses increased by only percent and our recurring revenue cost coverage ratio remains high at percent. Please turn to page seven for a breakdown of sales by product. 6Total sales were down percent at 4.7 trillion yen but remained strong. Sales of stocks were 3.1 trillion yen, substantially higher than the level seen before the first quarter, with this quarter being a notably strong one for primary subscriptions. Insurance sales were at a record high. As we continue to provide consulting for our clients’ overall portfolio, we are seeing more clients use insurance products for estate planning and retirement funds, which is another benefit from reallocating our Partners. Please turn to page eight for an update on KPIs. 7Net inflows of recurring revenue assets shown on the top left was 51.4 billion yen. This was lower than last quarter as the market rally prompted large sales and exits as the value of products had risen. However, excluding Corporate section, net inflows remained high at 151.5 billion yen. The top right shows recurring revenue assets at a record high of trillion yen and recurring revenue, which represents stable revenues, remained strong. Flow business client numbers shown on the bottom left were particularly strong this quarter as we saw the benefits of reassigning Sales Partners and enhanced dialog with clients on the back of primary transactions. Flow business client numbers at the end of December were trending percent above the same period last year at 1,456,000, which is getting close to our March KPI target. Our business for salaried employees, or workplace business, continued to grow steadily. The number of services delivered was approximately 3,600,000, driven by growth in ESOP participants. Please turn to page nine for an update on Investment Management. 8Net revenue decreased percent to 38.9 billion yen and income before income taxes declined percent to 15.6 billion yen. As you can see on the bottom left, stable business revenue was 33.3 billion yen, in line with last quarter which was a record high since the division was established in April 2021. Investment gain/loss declined to 5.6 billion yen as American Century Investments related valuation gain/loss slowed. Please turn to page for an update on the asset management business which is the source of business revenue. 9As shown on the top left, assets under management totaled 78.5 trillion yen at the end of December, representing a record high for the third straight quarter. This is above our March KPI target of 75.8 trillion yen. On the bottom left, net inflows were billion yen, with the investment trust business reporting billion yen of outflows. This was due to an increase in sales to lock in profits on the back of the market rally. MRFs and other money market funds reported billion yen of inflows as individuals parked more idle funds. The investment advisory and international businesses booked inflows of billion yen. Japan reported inflows into yen bond funds, while internationally we saw inflows into US high yield bond funds and India equity funds. Alternative assets under management shown on the bottom right stood at 1.6 trillion yen, down slightly due to yen appreciation at the end of the quarter. That said, inflows continued and we are making progress with our private market initiatives. Please turn to page for Wholesale. 10Net revenue increased percent to billion yen. Income before income taxes was billion yen, up percent. Performance is improving after having bottomed out in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. Although bonus provisions increased in line with performance, Wholesale non-interest expenses decreased percent as severance-related expenses declined and we saw the benefits of cost reductions carried out through to last quarter. As a result, our cost-to-income ratio dropped to percent. Please turn to page for an overview of results by business line. 11Global Markets net revenue was roughly flat at 171.6 billion yen. Fixed Income revenues increased percent to 103.5 billion yen. As I mentioned earlier, during the first half of the quarter, market participants remained on the sidelines over uncertainty surrounding monetary policy and geopolitics, but we executed client orders while stringently managing risk. Heading into the second half of the quarter as we gained clarity on the outlook for interest rates, market participant activity improved and we saw an increase in revenue opportunities. While market conditions weren’t easy, we booked stronger revenues across all core products such as Rates, FX/EM, Securitized products and Credit. Equities net revenue slowed percent to 68.2 billion yen. Equity Products had a strong quarter in the Americas, but revenues were lower in Japan and AEJ on muted volatility and client activity. Execution Services continued to deliver solid performance in Japan, with contributions from primary transactions and higher trading volumes on the back of heightened interest in Japanese equities from domestic and foreign institutional investors. Please turn to page for Investment Banking results. 12Net revenue was 45.4 billion yen, up percent driven by strong performance in Japan and EMEA. This represents the best quarter since the fiscal year ended March when comparisons are possible. As shown on the left, Advisory and Financing and Solutions both reported revenue growth. In Advisory, we topped the M&A league table, supporting numerous transactions including management buyouts of Benesse Holdings and Outsourcing and Bain Capital’s sale of its stake in Nichii Holdings to Nippon Life Insurance. In Financing transactions, we supported the efforts of corporates to strengthen their corporate governance through deals such as a large offering by Denso and an international offering by Asahi Group. We provided a diverse range of solutions for issuers, taking up the challenging of structuring new fundraising methods such as bond-type class shares issued by SoftBank and a digitally tracked green bond issued by Hitachi. Please turn to page for an overview of non-interest expenses. 13Groupwide expenses increased percent to 321.5 billion yen. Compensation and benefits increased percent to 170.6 billion yen. Although severance-related expenses declined, the increase is due to yen depreciation and higher bonus provisions in line with improved performance. Please turn to page for an overview of our financial position. 14Tier capital shown in the table on the bottom left was 3.4 trillion yen. Risk-weighted assets were 18.4 trillion yen. Our Tier capital ratio was 18.3 percent and we had a common equity Tier capital ratio of 16.2 percent, underscoring that we continue to maintain a robust financial position. That concludes the overview of our third quarter results. To sum up, spurred on by structural changes in the Japanese market, in the third quarter we were able to deliver steady results by leveraging our strengths centered on our home market and the strategic initiatives we have been implementing. Retail had its best set of results in eight years and Investment Banking revenues were at record levels as we provided a wide range of support for various corporate actions by Japanese companies. The Nikkei has continued to rally into and we get a real sense that the new NISA scheme has been a catalyst to kick start a full-fledged shift from savings to asset formation. In just the three weeks to last week, we saw NISA sales at over one third of annual sales for 2023. We expect Japanese corporates to step up efforts to enhance their corporate governance and raise capital efficiency and many corporates are coming to use for advice. Factoring in expectations of policy action by the Bank of Japan, we expect to see the good momentum of our Japan business continue. Our international business, in particular Macro Products, has had a tough time due to monetary tightening over the past two years. However, as interest rates finally peak out, we started to see signs of improvement towards the end of the quarter. In 2024, as market participants’ idle funds and pent-up demand takes off, we expect this positive trend to continue, albeit with different intensity in each region. In January, Retail revenues have remained around similar levels to the third quarter, while Wholesale revenues are outpacing the third quarter driven by solid performance in Rates in the Americas and Equity Derivatives in each region. When tailwinds are behind us in both Japan and overseas, it is a good time to tackle long-term issues. In order to build a business platform capable of achieving sustainable growth, we will expand our risk-light businesses and create a structure for consistent revenues while taking steps to further improve our ROE. Thank you. 1516171819202122232425262728293031
