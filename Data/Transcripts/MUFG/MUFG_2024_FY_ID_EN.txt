MUFG Investors Day Main Q&As Retail & Digital Business Group Q: What is the biggest challenge for the Retail & Digital Business Group? What is your view on the need for a business portfolio review? A: The biggest challenge is a lack of service collaboration among Group companies and a Group-wide reward program. To solve this issue, we will connect the services offered within the Group mainly through Direct, our online banking platform, under the current Medium- Term Business Plan to improve customer stickiness. For our business portfolio, we are enhancing our asset management business and approach to young generations, which have been our challenges, through investments in WealthNavi Inc. and Kanmu, Inc. We will also focus our efforts on home mortgages because it is an extremely important business that has an impact of improving customer stickiness. Q: I understand that the major cause of the deterioration in the expense ratio under the current MTBP is infrastructure investment. Can you tell us what impact the investment will have and when such an impact will materialize? A: In Phase of our infrastructure investment, we will seamlessly connect the services offered by our Group companies mainly through Direct before the end of fiscal 2024. This will enable customers to check their transactions with each company and use their services through Direct. In Phase 2, we will develop a platform for individual, customized proposals in cooperation with WealthNavi. We will work on these Phases and under the current MTBP, which will incur upfront expenses. We will use the platform created to generate earnings in the next MTBP. Q: What is your projected monthly active users of Direct after completing Phases and 2? A. We aim to have million MAU for Direct by March 2027. We want to continue increasing the number after the completion of Phases and 2. Going forward, the economic value of deposits will increase. We will therefore organize a service provision structure for the entire Group and secure deposits through an increase in Direct’s MAU. Q: Page of the material shows changes in LTV. What does the vertical axis indicate? Can you also tell us the background to the LTV moving sideways in each decade? A: We could not present specific numbers because we were estimating LTV. The vertical axis shows our revenue. This estimate covers all our customers and shows the average LTV including dormant accounts. If we focus on active accounts, the average LTV starts 1increasing from customers in their 20s and peaks for customers in their 50s to 60s. Q: What is the future direction of your collaboration with NTT Docomo, Inc. on BaaS? A: We launched a digital account service, “d Smart Bank,” in collaboration with NTT Docomo in December and have continued discussions with them to further evolve this service. We are discussing enhancing collaboration among services and improvements to functions, including adding a user flow to “d Smart Bank” to a list of functions of NTT Docomo’s “d Payment” app. Q: Regarding your credit card business, how are you going to compete against other companies’ point programs? A: As our credit card strategy, we will run a campaign that packages account opening with card issuance in Phase 1. In addition, we will run a reward boost program. In Phase 2, we will launch a loyalty program. The loyalty program will offer greater benefits to customers the longer they use the services of our Group. While we will flexibly consider the specific details of the services according to customer needs, we consider that this program will help differentiate us from other companies because there have not been many examples of this kind of program. Q: It appears that multiple, similar consumer finance services exist within the Group. What is the specific area each company operates in? A: Firstly, Kanmu is a deferred payment service, and the nature of its service is different. While ACOM and BANQUIC offers nearly identical CF services, their target age groups and annual income levels differ. They therefore complement each other. Q: What is your strategy to increase the stickiness of deposits as interest rates rise in the future? What is the impact of the rising yen interest rates on your earnings? A: In a world where interest rates are positive, it becomes important to retain funds within the Group. We will create a structure to retain funds somewhere in the Group through a Group- wide reward boost program and loyalty program. The earnings impact of the rising interest rates will vary depending on the assumptions we use. According to our estimate, a 1% rise in official interest rates will increase our deposit income by about to billion yen. In terms of stock, we have a large value of deposits compared with our competitors. In terms of flow, however, we are facing a challenge regarding the number of new account openings. We want to approach new customer groups through BaaS and our strategy centered on Direct. Q: You are planning to make various system investments under the current MTPB. What is 2your structure for controlling expenses and what measures do you take to prevent cost overrun? A: We will control expenses by rigorously narrowing down necessary functions. For instance, in our collaboration with WealthNavi, we are having discussions to narrow down necessary functions, while utilizing their excellent UI/UX knowhow. We will make well-targeted investments to meet our customers’ needs. We plan to invest billion yen in our IT systems under the current MTBP. We will strictly control the total investment amount to avoid any overrun. Q: What is your strategy for affluent customers? A: A certain number of customers will be classified as affluent customers through opportunities that significantly increase their personal assets such as retirement payments and inheritance. The recent change to the scope of responsibilities has made it possible to offer a consistent service for the different life events of our customers. For our affluent customers, we will offer services face-to-face, in addition to our digital channels, and approach them efficiently. Commercial Banking & Wealth Management Business Group Q: It appears that the growth rate of net operating profit of Wealth Management has slowed in comparison with its growth rate under the previous MTBP. What are the reasons? Is there any scope for an upturn? A: The absolute amount of WM’s net operating profit has fallen due to the changes made to the standards. This makes the growth look slower. However, the growth rate of WM’s net operating profit under the current MTBP is about 30%, which is above the growth rate of the entire Commercial Banking & Wealth Management Business Group. WM thus remains an engine of the entire Group. In addition, the robust market environment is currently helping asset management business make a significant growth in banking and securities. We can therefore hope for an upturn. Furthermore, solution fees have been rising in relation to asset succession on the back of the needs for purchasing properties or selling businesses. We intend to maintain this trend. Q: Please explain your credit control centered on LBO in the face of the rising interest rates? A: We rigorously manage credits while squarely facing our customers and supporting their efforts for business transformation. We accept LBOs after a rigorous screening. At this stage, we are not concerned about risks related to the rising interest rates. Q: Can you tell us your new initiatives to increase professional human resources, if any? A: The Commercial Banking & Wealth Management Business Group has approximately professionals and wants to increase their number to around 70. The Bank has introduced a 3system that would allow human resources with skills that can be used inside and outside the Bank and extremely high levels of productivity to engage in the same duties over long years. Our securities arm has also introduced a specific qualification system to develop professional human resources and hopes to develop professional human resources especially for its front-office duties. Q: What is the earnings contribution of your support for startups? How much of your balance sheet is used? A: We project our income from IPOs of startups to increase by around 1.0 billion yen during the three years under the current MTBP. Our goal is to treble the market capitalization of startups we support in comparison with its fiscal figure. We will recognize the income to be generated from their IPOs as the entire Commercial Banking & Wealth Management Business Group. We do not expect to use much of our balance sheet. We offer diverse financial solutions including fundraising through equity investments and factoring or credit card business for corporate customers. We will provide functions that are useful for our customers from multiple angles. Q: You have mentioned the allocation of human resources to the front-office sections. Please tell us the staffing situation of the Commercial Banking & Wealth Management Business Group. A: Our Business Group has approximately 15,000 staff members. If we take the Bank as an example, we have approximately 1,500 corporate relationship managers , 3,000 wealth management RMs, and approximately 8,000 to 9,000 people including management staff and non-RM staff members in branches who are involved in each of our key strategies. Q: What are your challenges in developing human resources? A: Our mission and strength are to meet the needs of our corporate clients as well as our individual clients who are mainly company owners. Nurturing the ability to capture the needs of both types of clients and the depth to offer diverse solutions requires a significant amount of knowledge. In addition, developing close relationships with company owners and finding out the true challenges of their business and stories about succession within their family require life experience, which one cannot obtain in a short space of time. We will work on human resource development by introducing a system to allow our staff members to work with clients for a long time and utilizing a human resource system that enables seniors to make use of their experience and knowledge. Q: What are the specific actions you are taking to facilitate autonomous business base management? A: We thought about how we could manage our bases with vigor and with a stronger sense of 4ownership. This thinking led to our efforts to facilitate autonomous business base management. Rather than applying the same strategy throughout all business bases, each business base develops a strategy under the initiative of their head based on the market characteristics of their region. In addition, we have revised our method to set performance goals. As a result, each business base sets their goals after discussing how they meet their customers’ expectations and how they generate earnings based on the past track record. I have taken time to speak with the heads of nearly branches in total and have observed that giving more autonomy to each business base has resulted in moves that may lead to human resource development and the transformation of corporate cultures. I feel these are good signs. Q: What is the magnitude of the earnings impact you expect from the rises in yen interest rates? A: This may depend on the competition environment; but we estimate that a 1% rise in official interest rates will increase our deposit income by to billion yen a year. Q: What are the specific potentials you are seeing regarding a white space of business succession? A: Of the 200,000 corporate customers of the Commercial Banking & Wealth Management Business Group, 70,000 companies, or one-third, satisfy certain criteria and are deemed as potential customers for our business succession service. Of these, we have confirmed with 14,000 companies that they intend to go ahead with business succession within the next one to three years. Of these 14,000 companies, 7,000 companies have concrete succession measures in place. We consider that we need to urgently approach the remaining 7,000 companies. We have the capabilities to work on the succession projects of almost 1,000 companies a year. We need to increase these capabilities through the expansion of human capital. Japanese Corporate & Investment Banking Business Group Q: What do you think was the cause of the incidents regarding administrative action? What is their impact on your business results? A: I want to offer my sincere apology for the concern we have caused you. I understand that our compliance awareness based on the correct understanding of laws and regulations and the development of a monitoring framework were inadequate while we facilitated Group collaboration using our total power. We will ensure that this will not occur again and endeavor to regain your confidence in the MUFG Group. At this stage, we do not expect that this incident will have a major impact on our business results. Q: What degree of impact do you expect the future drop in U.S. interest rates will have on your 5earnings? A: We estimate that falls in U.S. interest rates will have an impact of approximately minus 65.0 billion yen on foreign currency deposit interest income during the current MTBP. We will minimize the negative impact by maintaining the balance of deposits and ensuring that our pricing is based on the close monitoring of interest rate trends. Q: What is your outlook on the loan spread in the Japanese yen? A: We will take risks as before and ensure that our pricing can secure returns matching risks. We plan to maintain the trend from the previous MTBP and continue improving loan spreads under the current MTBP. Q: In your efforts to reduce your equity holdings, how much faster do you plan to reduce them based on your current negotiations with customers? To what assets are you going to allocate the reduced risk weighted assets ? A: We recognize that the sale of equities worth 350.0 billion yen is the minimum goal we should achieve. We will proactively execute sales to exceed this goal. In terms of the control of RWA, we want to strengthen our risk taking in highly profitable areas such as capital finance including mezzanine finance and non-recourse real estate loans. Q: In the approach for the co-creation of value, in which sectors does MUFG especially have strengths? A: We continue working on the approach for the co-creation of value, which was launched under the previous MTBP, as our new challenge. We are facilitating co-creation of value with our customers in three areas of space, GX, and semiconductor, as stated in the material. In addition, we continue having dialogues with our customers to create business opportunities for MUFG by developing new industries and businesses capturing the expansion of our customers’ business domains in sectors such as food, logistics, and mobility. We consider that the approach based on these domains will become a key point. Q: What are MUFG’s advantages over regional banks as you facilitate the approach for the co- creation of value? A: Take semiconductors as an example, we have ongoing projects in Hokkaido, Kyushu, and other regions, and collaboration with various companies from the upstream to downstream of the value chain including regional banks becomes important. To ensure that all concerned parties work as one, we need to make good use of our network, which is our strength. The semiconductor market is said to become a trillion dollars market by 2030. We want to seek new businesses while playing the role of a supplier of funds. Q: Please explain the relationship between revenue and expenses. In the previous MTBP, 6foreign currency deposit interest income rose significantly. Did you not think about strategically allocating the increased income to expenses? A: We do not manage revenues and expenses in specific areas by directly linking them. Under the current MTBP, we will control expenses in terms of their amount and ratios. Our target expense ratio for fiscal is 41%. We will strictly control our expense ratio while allocating expenses to the areas that will help increase gross profit such as human resources and infrastructure. Q: What types of businesses are you going to focus on in the future to increase non-interest income? A: Non-interest income includes solution businesses, transaction banking, domestic exchanges, foreign exchanges, among others. In addition, given the growing need for GX, we can expect fee income related to loans. Furthermore, in a world where interest rates are positive, there will be various opportunities in trust business. Capturing a multitude of these opportunities, we will steadily increase our non-interest income. [Global Commercial Banking Business Group] Q: What is the path you are envisioning to increasing ROE of your investments in digital finance service providers and investees in India to about 20%? A: These are areas that are expected to generate high growth. As a result, their valuations are quite high and, in the short term, there is a large amortization expense of goodwill. Accordingly, their ROE in fiscal will be in the negative. We will make up for the lack of short-term profits mainly with the growth and profit contribution of the existing partner banks. We will first enhance our profitability through the growth of the existing businesses to raise our ROE. Then, we will aim to further raise our profitability by leveraging the synergy created from the inclusion of our investees in the MUFG Group. Q: What do you perceive as challenges and key points in considering investments in India? A: With the growing domestic demand, India offers an environment where we can expect growths in personal and SME loans. The time is right. Having said that, India is an extremely difficult market in comparison with the Southeast Asian countries where we have been working in the last ten years. It is therefore essential that we work with reliable partners. When making investments, we comprehensively look at factors such as the superiority of business model, entry barriers, whether an ecosystem exists, and trust relationships with the authorities. In addition, we target later-stage companies that have established cash flows. This also applies to our investments in digital finance service providers. Q: Do financial targets under the MTBP include contributions from inorganic projects in India? 7What is your evaluation of the companies you invested in under the previous MTBP? A: As inorganic projects in India, the contribution of DMI Finance, in which we made an investment under the previous MTBP, is included in our financial targets. The business results of the companies we invested in during the previous MTBP period are going as planned, although only one to two years have passed since we made investments. Q: Looking at the 1Q financial results of KS, their growth seems to have slowed. What is your projection for their future loans, NIM, and credit cost? A: In the 1Q financial results, credit cost increased year on year, largely due to the companies outside Thailand. The countries where the investees are located have a fast-growing, high interest rate market. This leads to a large amount of credit cost, but we will control it well. With the slowdown of the Thai economy, arrears have been slightly increasing in the area of CF, especially auto loans, and losses have been incurred upon foreclosures due to the falling secondhand car prices. We have already taken measures to address these challenges, such as adopting a stricter credit screening approach. We will closely monitor the situation to ensure that KS’s portfolio will improve with the recovery in the economy. Q: Can you explain the situation of the diversification of income and credit cost at BDI? A: We have made infrastructure investments over the last year and are seeing both positive outcomes and challenges. BDI’s loan growth rate was the best in the industry in the two consecutive years in and and its image as a growth bank has been spreading. We attribute this to MUFG’s involvement in their management. Going forward, we will seek synergy through collaboration with Mandala Multifinance, Home Credit, and others, beyond entities. The challenge is their brand power to capture deposits. To acquire quality CASA that supports growing loans, BDI has renewed its IT systems, digital capabilities, and branches. The upgrading of branches, which BDI had implemented ahead of other initiatives, started to have an impact as demonstrated in an increase in transactions with new customers and customers seeking wealth management services. However, we consider that it will take more time for this to spread into a wider section of the community. With respect to credit cost, Adira Finance has seen its credit cost increase slightly more than the initial projection. As in Thailand, we will closely monitor if the economic cycle will reach the low income earners and endeavor to control credit cost. Q: Is there any scope of collaboration between MUFG’s subsidiaries and its investees such as ACOM’s easy buy and sales finance of JACCS in Indonesia? A: The products and target customers of each company are well segregated. To seek further collaboration opportunities in this situation, we held a conference named MODE to discuss digital strategy in Asia where our partner banks, investees, and affiliates including ACOM 8and JACCS gathered. Seeing that there are movements to adopt the cutting-edge technologies and knowhow introduced at the conference to their countries, we are hoping for further collaboration to occur. Global Corporate & Investment Banking Business Group Q: Your current MTBP target expense ratio 49% is ambitious. Do you plan on strategically spending expenses to achieve sustainable growth of profitability? A: It is certainly an ambitious target. We aim to achieve it while allocating resources to human capital and so on. Under the current MTBP, we will increase direct expenses by billion yen, while reducing indirect expenses by billion yen. We will hire highly skilled professionals for business promotion but also in Credits. This will lead to an increase in high value-added lending projects in the areas where we can win such as structured finance. Meanwhile, we will control indirect expenses by streamlining the legacy cost in Americas following the sale of MUB. Q: What are the earnings drivers for this MTBP? A: To improve interest income, it is important to optimize our balance sheet by reducing low profitable assets and increasing high profitable assets. Especially with respect to project finance, distribution efforts have taken root since the previous MTBP, and the breadth of asset class has expanded. In addition, we will focus on secured finance for institutional investors, which is one of the high value-added lending which captures the needs of investors. For non-interest income, distribution income will become one of the key earnings drivers. We have recently established an organization called Global Structured Solutions together with the Global Markets Business Group. We will improve the turnover ratio of the balance sheet by conducting the distribution of structured finance products that contains market risk. Furthermore, we will further progress the integrated operation with the Global Markets Business Group to enhance cross selling centered on Sales & Trading. Q: To become a Leading Global Debt House, which global peers are you benchmarking? Is there any specific target on the scale of profit? Any challenges? A: We have selected BNP Paribas, HSBC, and the Royal Bank of Canada as our benchmark. All these three banks have increased their earnings by focusing their capital investments in areas where they have strengths. We will solidify our position in the debt business in MUFG’s way, while comparing areas of strengths with benchmarks. Going forward, our challenge will be O&D. Under the previous MTBP, gross profits of banking and securities for primary has grown to around 1.1 billion US dollars. We believe there is room to grow. For further enhancement, we will implement incentives that will 9transform RM’s way of thinking and performing. Q: For the U.S. middle market and Asian market, what are your specific initiatives and timelines for collaboration with Morgan Stanley ? A: For the U.S. middle market, we have assigned roles within MUFG network: MS is in charge of IPOs, and Intrepid offers M&A advisory. We expect this collaboration to have an effect soon. We also believe the people recruited from Silicon Valley Bank to contribute in this area. In Asia, a number of countries such as India and Indonesia, are expected to grow. We will collaborate with MS by setting clear targets like we do in the U.S., while leveraging strong MUFG franchise. However, we are aware of the challenging nature of doing businesses in Asia due to a need to adapt to different laws and regulations of each country. Q: What are your major initiatives in EMEA, in terms of integrated operation of EMEA and Americas? A: Given the similarities of the markets in EMEA and Americas, the knowhow developed in the U.S., such as BSO, has been utilized in EMEA under the single leadership of Mr. Kevin Cronin. As a result, we nearly doubled operating profit in EMEA in the last three years without significantly increasing the size of the balance sheet. We will continue this initiative to build a leaner structure. As a new initiative, we will diversify O&D by utilizing funds in areas where MUFG has strengths, such as PF, in collaboration with the Asset Management & Investor Services Business Group. Q: What is the reason for your medium- and long-term ROE targets being lower than those of your global competitors? What are the measures that you are going to take to combat this? A: The ECM and M&A advisory services which MS is responsible for, have a very large wallet. We absorb our share as equity-method investment gain/loss. If we were to include equity- method investment gain/loss, the combined ROE of GCIB and Global Markets Business Group will increase by about 1%. We will further raise our ROE by working on enhancing structured finance and improving the asset turnover rate. Q: What measures are you going to take to address challenges around risk management enhancement? What is your projection for credit cost? A: Given the expected growth in businesses in non-investment grade areas, we will upgrade our portfolio risk management through rigorous selection of larger projects and enhance the check function of the second line of defense. Credit cost rose significantly in FY2023 due to the impact of individual projects. However, we currently do not expect any large cost to be incurred. 10Global Markets Business Group Q: What do you expect to come out of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy meeting in July? A: At the meeting in June, the BOJ announced that they would determine a specific and significant plan to reduce the purchase of the Japanese government bonds at their meeting in July for the next one to two years. The market expects that the BOJ will reduce its monthly purchase amount of JGBs from the current amount of around trillion yen to trillion yen at least within the next two years. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda mentioned the inflation risk through the depreciation of the yen at a press conference following the June meeting. The BOJ’s Summary of Opinions states, “It is therefore necessary for the Bank to consider whether further adjustments to monetary accommodation are needed from the perspective of risk management.” In addition, at a meeting of the BOJ’s regional branch managers in July, it was reported that wage raises at par with or exceeding the last year had been spreading not only among large companies but also among small- and medium-sized enterprises. Based on these factors, we consider that the July meeting will thoroughly deliberate on the reduction plan and whether it is necessary to raise official interest rates. Attention should also be paid to the impact of foreign exchanges on prices, the situation of domestic consumption that has started showing the signs of slight weakening, domestic and overseas political situations, the timing of interest rate reduction in the U.S., among other factors. Q: What is your view on the medium- and long-term monetary policy? A: At a press conference following the BOJ’s monetary policy meeting in April, Governor Ueda said that official interest rates in fiscal and would generally be close to neutral interest rates if prices are as projected by the BOJ. Accordingly, if the current situation where there is a positive prosect for achieving the price projection continues, there may be a possibility that official interest rates will be hiked to at least beyond the wall of 0.50% in the future and to the level of neutral interest rates, which are expected to be over 1.0%, in the next two to three years. Q: What is the level of interest rates at which you will start full-scale investment in JGBs? A: We continued managing our positions reasonably restrictively until the last fiscal year and shortened the average duration of our JGB holding to around one year. If interest rates rise to reasonable levels going forward, we will gradually recover our positions seeking the right level. Q: Please explain your shift from the BOJ’s current account to investments in bonds. A: Our balance sheet, especially the balance of our current account at the BOJ, are passively impacted by Japan’s macro monetary and fiscal policies, and therefore can fluctuate within a large range. Based on this premise, if we consider regulations on interest risk volume under 11IRRBB and others, replacing within the balance of our bond portfolio, reinvestments after redemption, and transfers from the BOJ’s current account to bonds, we could theoretically increase our investments in bonds by around to trillion yen. Q: What is your outlook for the U.S. monetary policy and U.S. interest rates? A: We expect U.S. interest rates will be cut by 0.25 to 0.50 percentage points once or twice in September, November, or December this year, which will reduce the federal fund rate to below 5%. After this, we expect the 10-year rate to remain within its range, but volatility will remain high as we need to pay attention to the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election and the possibilities for the re-acceleration of inflation and for the spread of concerns about fiscal deterioration. If Donal Trump is elected as the President, we are aware of the possible switch to interest rate hikes in the second half of the next year or later as a tail risk. Q: How are you going to manage your foreign bond portfolio from now on? A: We will continue cautiously managing our portfolio watching out for any increase in its valuation losses and deterioration in income gain, while closely monitoring the economic indicators and monetary policies of each country. With this approach, based on the premise that the inverted yield curve will continue, we will increase capital gains through flexible changes to our positions and aim to raise the overall return of the holding period, starting with U.S. Treasury Bond bear funds and short positions such as fixed payment and variable receipt U.S. interest swap transactions. In addition, we will sell bonds with high book value in exchange for capital gains to improve the average value of bond holdings and continue controlling the deterioration in interest income and evaluation losses. Furthermore, in lieu of fundraising using capital bonds, we will continue investing in high return mortgage bonds and so on as held-to-maturity bonds to maintain and improve net interest income. Our treasury management in this fiscal year had a good start. In the first quarter, we posted a significant amount of income thanks to flexible operations capturing the market movements. Q: Please explain the current status and future outlook of Alliance 2.0. Also, please tell us about your initiatives in new areas, if any. A: In collaboration with foreign exchange trading, we are using MS’ platform and working on connecting and consolidating the forex transaction flow. We aim to connect and consolidate all transactions in Japan by the end of this fiscal year and then aim to gradually complete connection and consolidation on the global base over the next year or so. We plan to internalize both companies’ transaction flow as soon as possible to offer high value-added services to our customers through an increase in the impact of our marriage including the further improvement to price competitiveness, faster speed, an increase in the number of transactions received and currency pairs, and an expansion of automated transactions using 12algorithm. Under the tough competition environment where the oligopolization of flows is progressing, we will maintain and expand our transaction volume and earnings. In terms of human resources, our bank has already sent over ten people to MS. We eventually plan to send around people including in areas such as front-office, IT and back-office. With respect to the future expansion of the areas of collaboration with MS, we will consider expanding the framework of collaboration utilizing MS’s function in carbon credit transactions and the incidental resource and energy areas and commodity areas such as foodstuff, as in the recent collaboration in forex trading operations. Asset Management & Investor Services Group Q: To what degree will you be able to increase net operating profit of the Asset Management & Investor Services Group over the medium- to long-term? In addition, how much capital do you plan to allocate to inorganic projects? A: Under the previous MTBP, AM/IS’ net operating profit grew from 75.0 billion yen to over 100.0 billion yen. This represents an annual growth rate of over 10%. We will maintain this level of growth under the current MTBP. In the medium- to long-term, the inflow of funds to the alternative asset area will be the key. The inflow has continued in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue for the next five to ten years. As long as this flow continues, we should be able to maintain the pace of growth. Naturally, inorganic projects are one of the options. These are, however, tools for achieving growth and not goals. We have therefore not determined any specific amount for acquisitions at this stage. Q: In addition to normal ROE, can you also disclose Tangible ROE to show profitability relative to actual cash flow? A: Following the improved sophistication of Business Group-specific ROE, AM/IS’s ROE target has been lowered from its target based on the former standard. While the MUFG Group will discuss which standard to use for Business Group-specific ROEs, we explained our inorganic strategy using pre-amortization and post-amortization ROEs in the material for the investor briefing in May. We will therefore consider disclosing these two types of ROE. Q: The fee rate has been declining for both AM and IS. Is there any countermeasure? Or are you thinking that you need to increase the volume to an extent? A: In the area of IS, there are many cases that adopt a fee schedule that gradually reduces fees as the balance of asset under management increases. We therefore expect that it is likely that the fee rate will keep falling going forward. We thus have no clear and effective means to reverse this trend. To maintain the current level or slow down the fall, however, we are focusing on three initiatives. The first is to 13increase businesses at a rate faster than a fall in the fee rate. In fact, gross profit of the AM business under the previous MTBP rose by approximately 8%, partly due to an increase in assets under management of the eMAXIS Slim series, which is a core product of MUAM. The second initiative is to reduce expenses through the improved efficiency achieved by raising the STP ratio and using AI. We have increased the net operating profit of the IS business by about 16% under the previous MTBP, despite the downward pressure on fees, by improving the efficiency of the IS business and reducing its expenses. The third initiative is to expand the peripheral operations of the existing services. Q: You have moved Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management to place it directly under the shareholding company. What are your specific strategies to make them the fourth pillar of MUFG? A: In April this year, we shifted MUAM from being a trust subsidiary to a company directly under MUFG to improve their corporate governance and to increase management transparency as an asset management company. There is, however, no major change in their growth strategy. Our strategy under the current MTBP is to first capture the movement created by the new NISA and to increase MUAM’s AUM from approximately trillion yen to around trillion yen. If we can maintain this pace, increasing their AUM to around trillion yen under the next MTBP may be possible. Next, we want to double the number of individual investors investing in the eMAXIS Slim series, a very popular series of the new NISA, from around million people to around million people in the future. As the number of account holders of the new NISA is forecast to reach around million in the future, we aim to capture 50% of this number to become a national fund and to support our earnings. We consider that our path to make MUAM the fourth pillar is to first increase its presence in the domestic AM industry and then build a No.1 AM company in terms of its asset management performance together with an increase in its AUM. Q: To achieve the goal of having trillion yen of AUM, how much AUM are you going to increase in which areas? Please explain the breakdown of organic and inorganic initiatives as well. A: AUM of MUFG’s entire AM business stood at trillion yen at the end of fiscal 2023. The balance increased at an annual rate of over 9% under the previous MTBP and we expect almost the same level of growth under the current MTBP. We consider that MUAM, which manages the well-performing eMAXIS Slim series, will be a main growth driver to achieve trillion yen in AUM. We project MUAM’s AUM to increase by approximately trillion yen mainly from individual investors. In addition, we expect AUM to increase in our trust business and FSI mainly through transactions with Japanese and overseas institutional investors. The remaining amount may come from the development of new hit products 14following the eMAXIS Slim series. Inorganic expansion may also become one of the options. Q: The material states that some of the assets in credit and alternative areas will be transferred from the Global Markets Business Group to AM/IS. To what degree do you plan to increase the size of assets? Going forward, will you be able to accept outside money?
