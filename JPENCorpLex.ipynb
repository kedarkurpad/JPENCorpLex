I would like to ask you for the fair value of Arm. I am making a question here, looking at page 27 of the Finance section. It was 4.35 trillion yen in September quarter, and it is now 3.75 trillion yen. I believe that this is adjusted down because of strong yen, but even discount it back, the valuation is still 2.3 billion yen lower. If my understanding is correct, I would like to ask you what is the background for that? I would like to ask from Ian, what is your prospects for the short-term period? And give us some color on your prospects for the future. Thank you. (Govil) You are right, there is a small fluctuation in the valuation of Arm. It is driven by non- performance factors, primarily foreign exchange, with a portion due to cost of capital increases. (Thornton) Regarding the opportunity for Arm going forward, hopefully you saw Goto-san’s presentation this morning when he talked about all of the new products and technologies that we all use needing more and more computer chips. There was one graph that he showed on Page 61, if you have his presentation in front of you, which shows how the semiconductor industry which was growing at about a 5% CAGR, I think that is between 2012 and 2018, has really started to accelerate in the last few years to about a 15% CAGR. That is entirely driven by more devices that we use, using more chips, and using more expensive chips. This is creating a very rich environment for Arm to license its products into and also then to collect royalties on because Arm technology is very broadly exposed into smartphones, consumer electronics, enterprise electronics, and automotive, and now as well servers and networking equipment. I am not going to give any specific numbers here today. Obviously, we are preparing for an IPO, and so we cannot give numerical forecast, but I think you can see that the environment in which we are operating is very favorable. 1 Thank you. My question for the Vision Funds. Navneet, if we look at the public valuations since the start of this quarter, seems to be pretty positive. Could you comment on, are you getting a kind of positive inflection feedback from your portfolio companies? And you talked about the cash position very strong at the moment, but are there any risks you still see from your portfolio? Just in general, if you could comment on this? Thank you. (Govil) Sure. Thank you. So, a couple of things. If you look at 2022, I would say the first half of 2022 we took significant write-downs, and those were driven by basically market multiples and the rerating of market multiples, especially the public company peers of our portfolio companies. Then what we started seeing in the second half of 2022 is that a lot of our portfolio companies were revising their forecasts, their future growth forecasts, and that led to us taking down their valuations. You are right, in terms of year-to-date it has only been a few weeks in 2023. The public markets at least in the first few weeks, they seem to be constructive. But ultimately, what we will have to see is the actual performance of our portfolio companies during the March quarter and beyond. In terms of the runway, you mentioned the cash runway, we are very well positioned. You know, portfolio companies are looking for strategic opportunities, both M&A as well as partnerships. They are increasing their operational and financial resistance. As you said, on average the portfolio, 94% of the portfolio has more than 12 months runway. Okay. You are not yet hearing from them that things are really picking up, but the market is moved. So, you are waiting to see the results. (Govil) That is right. I have questions on Vision Funds, and then I have a question on Arm. I will start with Vision Funds. This is maybe like a follow-up to what the gentleman was just asking earlier, but looking at it from the other side, is that if your portfolio companies are starting to guide down now, when you look at possible future investments in companies that you are talking to that are looking to raise money, have their expectations for valuation come down to levels that you think are reasonable? (Govil) Thank you. In some cases, yes. What is also happening is typically when a company does a down round*, they usually go to their existing investors in the cap table. They do not necessarily 2want to bring in new investors. So, as far as our portfolio companies are concerned because they are very well capitalized and they have significant cash runways, there are not that many of our portfolio companies tha\n"]}],"source":["import re\n","\n","def minimal_clean_text(text):\n","    # Remove only basic headers, dates, and speaker labels\n","    text = re.sub(r'\\d{4}年\\d+月\\d+日（.*?）|[A-Za-z]+\\s\\d{1,2},\\s\\d{4}', '', text)  # Dates\n","    text = re.sub(r'(Speaker|質問者)\\s*\\d+|Q\\d+[:：]|A\\d+[:：]', '', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)  # Speaker labels\n","\n","    # Remove extra whitespace and newlines without re-encoding\n","    text = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text).strip()\n","\n","    return text\n","\n","# Test the function on one file\n","sample_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/JPENCorpLex/Data/Transcripts/SoftBank/SoftBank_2022_Q3_QA_EN.txt'\n","with open(sample_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n","    raw_text = file.read()\n","\n","# Apply minimal cleaning\n","cleaned_text = minimal_clean_text(raw_text)\n","print(cleaned_text[:5000])  # Displaying the first 5000 characters as a sample\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Z5gXhKpmTFn9"},"source":["# Step 6: Refine Text Cleaning\n","\n","This code defines a more refined function, `refined_clean_text`, which further cleans the extracted text by:\n","- Removing dates in both Japanese and Western formats.\n","- Eliminating speaker labels, such as \"Speaker 1\" and \"質問者1\".\n","- Removing text within parentheses and any phrases following asterisks, specifically targeting footnotes.\n","- Cleaning up orphaned words or symbols.\n","- Performing a final cleanup of whitespace and newlines to ensure a tidy output.\n","\n","The function is then tested again on the sample text file, with the cleaned text printed for review."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":70,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728026311699,"user":{"displayName":"KF Kurpad","userId":"16973726104940056767"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"4aVjTdgU8YJv","outputId":"4aa5803c-5ac2-4827-db2f-9f2e84babca0"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["SoftBank Group Corp.: FY22Q3 Investor Call Q&A Presenters: Yoshimitsu Goto, Board Director, Corporate Officer, Senior Vice President, CFO & CISO, Head of Finance Unit & Administration Unit Kazuko Kimiwada, Corporate Officer, Senior Vice President, Head of Accounting Unit Navneet Govil, CFO, Member of the Executive Committee, SB Global Advisers Ian Thornton, VP Investor Relations, Arm Limited Thank you very much for taking my questions.
